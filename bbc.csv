BBC,17 hours ago,"It's been three weeks since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people. Israel has retaliated with intense bombing on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 5,000 people.Western leaders have been visiting Israel to show their support for the country - and to ask Israeli leaders to adhere to international law and protect civilians in Gaza. A ground invasion of Gaza is expected, though there is no clear indication of when that might happen.The situation on the ground remains fast-moving and complex. Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have attempted to bring some clarity to the picture by answering questions submitted by BBC readers - you can read their answers below.Richard Jones asks: What is the likelihood of a larger war in the Middle East and would that be of great concern to the Israelis?Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Jerusalem, says:It's clearly in the minds of everyone, and why a host of foreign leaders and diplomats have made their way to Israel over the past couple of weeks.The main focus of concern is along Israel's northern border, where exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the powerful Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, have escalated day by day.Israel has deployed troops and armour to the border and taken the precaution of evacuating tens of thousands of civilians from vulnerable communities.Hezbollah is backed by Iran, which has warned that it might have to intervene if the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.For Israel, Hezbollah's stock of sophisticated missiles represents a much greater potential threat than Hamas.The US has sent additional weaponry to Israel and deployed a carrier task force to the eastern Mediterranean as a powerful signal to Hezbollah and Iran.But while the violence of recent days is alarming, it doesn't yet seem as though Hezbollah has taken a definitive decision to join the fight.Caroline Kelly asks: Regarding Israel's blockade of Gaza over the last two weeks - does this mean that there is literally no water, fuel and electricity available to the people of Gaza?Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, in Jerusalem, answers:Israel said it was imposing a ""complete siege"" on Gaza. The energy minister Energy Minister Israel Katz said after Hamas's attacks there would be no supply of power or water until the hostages were released - calling this ""humanitarian for humanitarian"".Since 2006, Israel had already imposed a tight blockade, backed by Egypt, on Gaza after Hamas consolidated its grip on the territory. Israel said this was to stop weapons-making supplies getting in.But it meant life for ordinary citizens was made much tougher as Israel and Egypt controlled everything that went in and out; except for what reached Gaza via smuggling tunnels from Egypt.Now there's no access at all except for those few aid lorries getting over the border from Egypt since Saturday and Israel allowing piped water for a few hours a day in eastern Khan Younis.It means the only remaining sources of power and drinkable water inside Gaza are stocks from before this conflict - including private stores of diesel for generators (which can also power water filter systems in people's homes), remaining stocks of bottled water and private wells - this water is often polluted and needs to be filtered.From an anonymous emailer: How likely is it that Israel will be able to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas?Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says:Because of the very high number of hostages held in Gaza - more than 200 - the odds on Israel being able to rescue all of them by force are not good.As we know, two hostages were released last Friday after mediation by Qatar - and another two were released on Monday. The Qataris believe more could follow but some people are suggesting this could be a delaying tactic by Hamas to deter Israel from making its expected military incursion into Gaza.The Israelis have a lot of expertise in hostage rescue and their Special Forces unit, Sayaret Matkal, has trained intensively for just such an operation.But they face a tough challenge. Some or all of the hostages are likely to be held underground in tunnels and bunkers, in some cases being moved around from one secret location to another.If their captors thought their hostages were on the verge of being rescued they would quite possibly try to kill them first. So, any rescue operation will be immensely risky.Rosemary Maltus-Smith asks: Who started funding for Hamas historically? Who funds Hamas today? How do they fund Hamas?Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem, says:In its early days, Hamas was funded by some Palestinian expats and private donors, particularly in the Arab Gulf. Some Islamic charities also sent money.Those sources of funding became much more difficult after it was widely designated as a terrorist entity by the US, European Union and others.Importantly, Hamas now receives material and financial support from Iran.In recent years, with a dire economic situation in Gaza, Qatar - which has given aid to the Palestinian territory - has been allowed to help it pay the wages of its thousands of government workers.The US Treasury also says that Hamas has a secret international investment portfolio, which generates large sums though its assets, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, with companies operating in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries.Mary Freeman asks: How many innocent lives need to be lost before the West calls for a ceasefire?Paul Adams says:The death toll so far is staggering. More than 1,400 Israelis killed and more than 5,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. That's an appalling loss of life, even by the terrible standards of the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.From my experience of previous rounds of violence, the West allows Israel time to punish Hamas before it starts calling for restraint, let alone a ceasefire. Western governments are generally sympathetic to Israel's desire to punish Hamas.But this latest war is different. Israel isn't setting out merely to punish Hamas (""mowing the grass"" as it has sometimes been dubbed in the past). This time, Israel is determined to eradicate the movement once and for all - politically and militarily.That's going to involve a great deal more human suffering, and judging by the West's support for Israel so far - notwithstanding Joe Biden's warning to Israel not to act out of blind rage - it seems that Israel will be able to pursue its objectives for some time before its allies say enough is enough.Alex in Cyprus wants to know whether there has been any indication from Fatah that they are willing to take over Gaza, which they lost to Hamas.Yolande Knell answers:So, some background first: Fatah is the secular political faction which is the main rival to Hamas.The Fatah leader is President Mahmoud Abbas who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.He is also the chair of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - which is the umbrella group that is internationally recognised as representing the Palestinian people.Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not part of the PLO, which has been the negotiator in past rounds of direct peace talks with Israel.The PA governed Gaza but Hamas took full control there in 2007, ousting PA security forces in bloody street battles. This was a year after Hamas won parliamentary elections.We saw the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting President Abbas when he rushed to the region after the war started in Gaza.Last week, I met Sabri Saidam, a former PA minister, who is a senior Fatah official and close to Abbas. I asked him whether the PA was being urged to return to Gaza after this war.He told me: ""Israel wants to discuss the future, America wants to discuss the future. The Palestinian leadership is quite clear - it feels strongly about it. It will not come to control Gaza and the people of Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank.""Do Western governments have a red line for Israel in this conflict, asks Sam.Frank Gardner replies:If they do then we have heard very little about it. There is also no one single unified ""Western position"" on this conflict in the way that there has been within Nato over the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.The sheer savagery and cruelty of Hamas's attack on civilians in southern Israel on 7 October meant that many Western leaders rushed to offer Israel their full support.However, as Israel's retaliatory air strikes have subsequently pummelled Gaza, causing appallingly high civilian casualties, there are growing misgivings amongst Israel's friends that the Netanyahu government is going too far.""Don't be blinded by anger in the way we were in the US after 9/11"" is the message President Biden gave Israel during his brief visit there last week.All Western leaders have called on Israel not to breach international humanitarian law, yet that is exactly what UN agencies are now accusing Israel of doing as it bombs crowded areas and forces more than a million people out of their homes.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,21 hours ago,"This video can not be playedWatch: A day of violence and fearThe Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages.Gaza's health ministry says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, and a ground offensive is expected.There remains a ""dire need of humanitarian aid"" in Gaza, the UN has warned.At least 34 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies were allowed through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt over the weekend.However, this provided only a fraction of the needs of people in Gaza, which normally receives 400 to 500 lorries every day.The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said access to clean water was severely limited and that ""concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high"".An estimated 1.4 million people in Gaza have been displaced, according to the UN.Hundreds of thousands moved from the north of the territory to the south, after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety.The southern city of Khan Younis, normally home to 400,000 people, has seen its population increase to more than a million. Many families are sharing homes, or sleeping in tents.However, Israel has also continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas military targets in southern Gaza.Some of those who initially fled the north of Gaza are now returning because the situation in the south is so bad, the UN has said.The World Health Organization has also warned that it is ""almost impossible"" for patients in hospitals in northern Gaza to be evacuated.Israel's stated goal is to destroy Hamas.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday that the next stage of the operation in Gaza - an expected ground offensive - ""may take a month, two or three, but at the end there will be no more Hamas"".Israel also wants to bring back the hostages that Hamas seized.Israel has massed tens of thousands of soldiers along the Gaza perimeter fence, along with tanks and artillery. It has activated some 300,000 reservists, alongside its standing force of 160,000.Hamas is thought to have about 25,000 people in its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.The Israeli military is preparing for an offensive by bombarding hundreds of targets inside Gaza.One of its main targets is Hamas's vast labyrinth of underground tunnels,  which contain bunkers for leaders and operational headquarters.Hamas has previously claimed the tunnels stretch for 500km (310 miles). Many have entrances hidden within houses, mosques, schools and other public buildings.Israel's troops are likely to avoid going into tunnels unless they have to, instead using explosives to destroy them.A major challenge for the Israeli troops will be close-quarters fighting in densely populated urban areas. It is thought that Hamas will lay booby traps and improvised explosive devices at entry points such as doorways, and along narrow streets.On Monday, the Israeli military said one Israeli soldier was killed and several others wounded during a raid into Gaza, to try and find hostages and to clear the way for a ground attack.The leaders of the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy on Sunday ""reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism"" and called for ""adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians"".Hamas is a Palestinian militant group which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The group is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state.Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power. It has fired - or allowed other militant groups to fire - thousands of rockets into Israel, and has carried out other deadly attacks.In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes. In 2008 and 2014, it also sent troops into Gaza.Together with Egypt, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007 for what it describes as security reasons.Hamas - or in some cases its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers.Iran backs the group, providing it with funding, weapons and training.On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by breaking through the heavily-fortified perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.It was the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation, according to the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen.The gunmen killed 1,400 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.Given the resources of Israel's security services, it was astounding that the attack by Hamas was not anticipated, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says.It came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions.This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel.Hamas might also have been seeking to score a significant propaganda victory to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians.The capture of Israeli hostages is thought to be designed to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.The Israeli military currently believes 222 people are being held in Gaza.They include 20 children and at least 10 people aged over 60. Soldiers were also taken hostage.The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.Originally occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day war.Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005.It is home to 2.23 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world.Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN. More than 500,000 of them live in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and has strictly controlled the movement of people and goods.The West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century.These were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by many Jews as their ancient homeland.Israel was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist.Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party, a bitter rival of Hamas.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,23 hours ago,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 220 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 5,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation.Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One.The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups.Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people.This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city.That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the ""Catastrophe""By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza.Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on.These include:Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented.Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities.Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition.It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,36 minutes ago,"The Israeli military said on Monday that 222 people were being held hostage by Hamas - but later in the day two hostages, both elderly women, were freed. Israel named them as Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifschitz.On Friday 20 October, two US hostages - a mother and daughter - were also freed. Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously said the hostages include 20 children and between 10 and 20 over-60s.The IDF have notified some families that their loved ones are being held hostage, while other families - whose relatives remain unaccounted for - believe they have been taken.These are the stories of hostages taken from Israel on 7 October which have been either confirmed by the BBC or credibly reported.This list is regularly updated and names may change, as some people feared kidnapped are confirmed to have been killed or released.Last updated on 24 October 2023 at 15:26 BSTAmiram Cooper 85, and his wife Nurit, 80 were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel close to Gaza, their daughter-in-law Noa told the BBC. The family last spoke to the couple during the Hamas attack, Noa said, when the couple were in their safe room. The family later traced Amiram's phone to Gaza. On Monday 23 October, Nurit was one of two women to be released.Oded Lifshitz, 83, and his wife Yocheved, 85 were taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz. On Monday 23 October, Yocheved was one of two elderly women to be freed. After hearing the news of her mother's release, their daughter Sharone - a London-based artist - said: ""While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those - some 200 innocent people - who remain hostages in Gaza.""Sharon Alony Cunio, 34, her husband David Cunio, 33, and their three-year-old twin daughters Emma and Julie; Sharon's sister Daniele Alony Mevneh and her daughter Amelia Mevneh, five, were kidnapped from a kibbutz in southern Israel, Sharon and Daniele's brother Moran told CNN. Moran said he was told by a witness that the family had taken shelter in a safe room but Hamas had then set fire to the house - they were taken hostage after leaving to escape the flames.Dafna Garcovich and her husband Ivan Illarramendi Saizar - who have Israeli-Chilean and Spanish citizenship respectively - were kidnapped from their homes, Dafna's father said. On 19 October, the Israeli Foreign Ministry stated that the couple were being held hostage in Gaza.Margalit Mozes, 78, was seen in a video clip being taken away from her home in Nir Oz by Hamas, her brother Chanon Cohen told CBS. She has health problems that require almost constant medical care, her family said.Eitan Yahalomi, 12, was driven away from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on one moped, and his mother Bat-Sheva and two sisters on another. Bat-Sheva, who is a French national, told a press conference that she managed to escape with her daughters but that she lost sight of Eitan as he was driven towards Gaza. Bat-Sheva's husband Ohad was shot and injured earlier, as he tried to defend the family in their home, and is now missing.Judith Weinstein Haggai, 70, and husband Gad, 73, were also missing from Nir Oz after the Hamas attack. Ten days later, the Israeli military confirmed to the family they had been taken hostage, CTV News in Canada reported.Adina Moshe, 72, was identified by her family in a video clip showing her wedged between two Hamas fighters on a motorbike, apparently taking her to Gaza. She had also been kidnapped from Nir Oz, her relatives told CNN.Alex Danzig, 75, a scholar and historian of the Holocaust, was at his home in Nir Oz, when it was attacked by Hamas on 7 October. ""We know for sure he was kidnapped,"" his son Mati told the BBC. Alex - whose older sister Edith is a Holocaust survivor - has spent the last 30 years working for Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust remembrance centre. His disappearance has triggered a campaign for his release, both in Israel and in Poland, the country of his birth.Hagar Brodutch, 40, her daughter Ofri, 10, and sons Yuval, 8, and Oria, 4, were at Kfar Aza, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza, when Hamas struck, according to Avichai Brodutch, Hagar's husband and the children's father. He told ABC News that he initially believed they were dead - but then received a message from the kibbutz that they had been seen alive, being led away.Doron, Raz and Aviv Asher were taken captive while staying with relatives near the Gaza border. Husband Yoni saw a video of his wife and daughters, aged 5 and 3, being loaded onto a truck with other hostages. He also traced her mobile phone to Gaza.Meirav Tal, her partner Yair Yaakov, and his children Yagil, 12, and Or, 16, are listed among the hostages. The children's mother, Ranana, was on the phone with them when Hamas arrived, and heard her youngest son cry: ""Don't take me, I'm too young!"" A video also appears to show Yair and Meirav with their captors.Amit Shani, 16, was ordered into a car by Hamas gunmen after they broke into the family's safe room in Kibbutz Be'eri, his mother told the New York Times.Tsachi Idan was last seen by his wife, Gali, as he was taken away by Hamas gunmen. Their family had been ambushed in their safe room in Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Their ordeal was live-streamed by Hamas. Their eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot dead, Gali told the BBC.Ron Scherman, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, was kidnapped at a border crossing, his mother Maayan told Israel's i24 news channel. She later identified him in a video posted by Hamas, she said.Shiri, Yarden, Ariel and Kfir Bibas are believed to have been abducted from the kibbutz in southern Israel where they lived and where Shiri was a kindergarten teacher. Shiri was pictured holding Ariel, aged 3, and 9-month-old Kfir, surrounded by Hamas gunmen.Yossi and Margit Silberman, Shiri's parents, are also missing and thought to have been captured.Daphna Elyakim, 15, and her sister Ella, 8, were seen on video being held in their home in the Nahal Oz kibbutz, relatives said. The girls' father Noam Elyakim, Noam's partner Dikla Arava, and her 17-year-old son Tomer were killed. Relatives said Ella and Daphna have appeared in photos posted by Hamas.Karina Ariev, a 19-year-old soldier, was serving at an army base near Gaza when she was kidnapped. Her sister Alexandra told the BBC she heard shooting as Karina called her during the attack, and later saw a video showing Karina being taken away in a vehicle.Ofer, Erez and Sahar Kalderon were taken prisoner in Kibbutz Nir Oz. A video on social media appeared to show 12-year-old Erez being taken by gunmen towards Gaza, their relative Ido Dan told the BBC. Two other relatives, 80-year-old Carmela Dan and her granddaughter, Noya, 12, were also believed to have been taken, but Israeli authorities later announced they had been found dead.Mia Shem, 21, from Shoham, appeared in the first hostage video released by Hamas saying that she had been abducted from a party. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed she was taken hostage and said they were in touch with her family, who agreed images from the video could be shown.Channah Peri, 79, and her son Nadav Popplewell, 51, were taken hostage by Hamas, said Channah's daughter Ayelet Svatitzky, who was speaking to them on the phone when the gunmen burst in. She said the captors sent pictures of her two relatives, who both have diabetes, with armed men in the background.Omri Miran, 46, was abducted after his family opened the door to their secure shelter to an Israeli child, who said he would be killed otherwise. Omri's wife, Lishay Lavi, said she saw him being taken away in handcuffs with three other hostages from the Nahal Oz kibbutz.Liri Elbag, 18, had just started military training as an Army lookout near the Gaza border when Hamas attacked, her father Eli told the Associated Press. Eli said he saw her in a video circulated later by Hamas, crowded with others on the back of a military truck which had been seized by the gunmen.A number of people are believed to have been abducted from the Supernova music festival in southern Israel. Among them:Moran Stela Yanai, 40, a jewellery designer, was selling her work at the festival when the attack happened. She was later seen in a video sitting on the ground surrounded by derogatory Arabic text about Jews, her brother told the Associated Press.Almog Meir Jan, 21, tried to flee the festival. He and a friend made it to the friend's car but only managed to drive a short distance before being forced to stop. Almog's family say they have seen a hostage video in which he appears.Inbar Heiman, a student aged 21, was seen by two young Israeli men being taken away from the festival on a motorcycle. Hamas have released a video in which Inbar is seen very briefly.Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, from California, was seen by witnesses being loaded onto a truck, his family told the Los Angeles Times. He was badly injured and unconscious, the witnesses said, and his last known phone location showed him on the border with Gaza.Maya Regev, 21, and her brother Itay, 18, from Herzliya are also believed to have been taken. On the morning of the attack, Maya's father got a call from his daughter who screamed ""Dad they're shooting at me, I'm dead"". The family said they later spotted Itay in handcuffs in the back of a vehicle in a video released by Hamas. Almost two days later, the Israeli army informed the family that both Maya and Itay had been abducted.Shani Louk, a tourist from Germany, is thought to be among those seized. Her mother, Ricarda, said she had seen a video of Shani after she was taken and later said she had information that Shani was in a critical condition in Gaza following a head injury.Noa Argamani, a Chinese-born Israeli citizen, was also kidnapped from the festival. Video footage - verified by her father Yaakov Argamani to Israel's Channel 12 - shows the 25-year-old being taken away on the back of a motorbike screaming, ""Don't kill me!""Bar Kuperstein, 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information.Eliya Cohen, 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow.

BBC,16 October,"The world is still reeling from the unprecedent assault by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, and the subsequent retaliatory strikes by Israel and expected land invasion into the Gaza Strip.We have received hundreds of your questions about the conflict, its impact and where it may end, with many people asking if other countries will get involved in the war.Our correspondents, many currently in the region, have answered some of the most frequently asked questions below.Craig Johnson in Skelmersdale, UK asks: If Iran gets directly involved in the conflict, would that prompt the US and its allies to directly join the war? And could this lead to a third world war?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel, says:When asked about the possibility of intervention by Iran or its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Joe Biden said: ""Don't.""The Americans just deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean to send a very firm message to Iran to stay out.They're saying that if anyone intervenes, they will have American military might to reckon with, not just Israel's.One of the major fault lines in the Middle East runs between the US and its allies, and the Iranians and theirs.Both sides are aware of the risks. If it went from a cold to a hot war it would ignite a Middle East conflagration of global significance.Luciano Sisi in the Scottish Borders asks: What is Israel's overall objective with the anticipated ground war?Lyse Doucet, our chief international correspondent, in southern Israel says:In past wars, Israel vowed to ""hit Hamas hard"", to destroy its capacity to fire rockets into Israel - including its vast web of subterranean tunnels.This time is different. Israel is vowing ""to destroy Hamas"" - an organisation it says should be obliterated, like the Islamic State group.Israel has the military might to smash Hamas's infrastructure, crush its tunnels, and cripple its command and control networks.But it's not clear how much Israel knows about what awaits in Gaza. Hamas's military prowess, including an astonishingly granular understanding of Israeli security that enabled it to outsmart its formidable defences, has shocked Israelis.Hamas is likely to possess the same sophistication when it confronts what it knows will be a ferocious Israeli response.And unlike the Islamic State group, Hamas is also a political and social organisation embedded in Palestinian society.A military onslaught can destroy its metal and concrete but not the mettle of the people whose resolve to die for their cause will only harden.Andrew Parker in the UK asks: What was the goal of the initial Hamas attack?Frank Gardner, our security correspondent, tells us:The reason given at the time by Hamas's spokesman Mohammed Al-Deif was that ""enough is enough"".The attack, he said, was in response to what Hamas called constant provocations and humiliations suffered by Palestinians at the hands of Israelis in both Gaza and the West Bank.Analysts believe there may have been other, undeclared reasons.Before the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were well on the way to normalising ties.This was opposed by both Hamas and its backer, Iran. The Saudis have now suspended those talks.But there will have been more to it than that.Hamas's leadership will have noticed the sharp divisions in Israeli society caused by judicial reforms introduced by the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.They aimed to deal Israel a painful blow - and in that they succeeded.Diana in the UK, who asks: Muslims speak of the family and brotherhood of Islam. How can Muslims in Egypt justify keeping their border with Gaza closed?Jeremy Bowen, our international editor, reporting from southern Israel says:Islam is a faith but it doesn't necessarily transcend the politics of national security.I'm certain millions of Egyptian Muslims want to alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza.But the Egyptian government, even at quiet times, does not allow routine access from Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Egypt has been the junior partner in earlier versions of Israel's siege of Gaza ever since Hamas took over there in 2007.Hamas has its roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, an organisation founded in Egypt a century ago. The Brotherhood wants to reshape states and society in line with Islamic teaching and belief.The Egyptian military opposes that desire. It overthrew an elected Muslim president in 2013.Egypt's current regime has relations with Hamas, and has in the past been the link between Hamas and Israel. But it does not want an influx of Palestinian refugees.The camps in Gaza still exist 75 years after they were established to house refugees - forced out by newly independent Israel - who have never been allowed home.Simon in the UK asks: The world issued an international arrest warrant against Putin. Why has there not been the same response against Hamas leadership? Was this not a war crime on a massive scale?Paul Adams, our world affairs correspondent answers:Israel did not consider itself at war with Hamas before 7 October, despite previous rounds of conflict stretching back many years.For Israel, this was an act of terrorism, not war.Benjamin Netanyahu's government is pursuing justice in its own way and has already killed at least two Hamas commanders it regards as responsible for the massacres.It will doubtless attempt to kill many more.Questions may arise about the organisation's political leadership - which lives in Qatar and Lebanon - who, some say, were unaware of the military wing's plans to attack inside Israel.This video can not be playedWatch: One week on - survivor Shye Weinstein recalls fleeing the Supernova festivalSadul Hoque from London asks: If everyone has agreed that Israel has been killing civilians and will kill a lot more in these new strikes, why are the UN and other countries not intervening?James Landale, our diplomatic correspondent gives this answer:The main reason why many countries are not urging Israel to stop its airstrikes is because they accept the country has been attacked by Hamas and has a right to defend itself.Where they are urging restraint is about how Israel defends itself.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said this morning: ""I've raised with the Israeli prime minister the need to minimise the impact on civilians as best we can.""The United Nations too has urged Israel to avoid civilian casualties.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said a few days ago: ""International humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld; civilians must be protected and also never used as shields.""Israel insists its warplanes and artillery are striking Hamas targets in Gaza. But many civilians are indeed being killed and injured in those strikes.Palestinians say that is because the Israeli strikes are excessive and indiscriminate. Israel says it is because Hamas uses civilians as human shields.An anonymous reader asks: How is it possible that the Israeli military have enough intelligence and surveillance to know exactly where Hamas is stationed in Gaza, but it didn't know Hamas were going to attack Israel or see any warning signs of the attack?Yolande Knell, our Middle East correspondent, in Jerusalem, says:In the past, Israel's military has opened up its control centre for surveillance of Gaza to journalists, and it's clear that it has excellent real-time information about movements on the ground from drones and other cameras.It also has a vast network of informants.We saw in May's fighting with Islamic Jihad just how accurate Israel's information on the whereabouts of leading militants could be.In briefings, Israeli military officials accept there have been major intelligence and security failings when it comes to the unprecedented, deadly attack by Hamas.However, we can rely on the fact that it has an accurate, long list of Hamas targets that it will go after as soon as it gets boots on the ground.Further north from the Gaza Strip, tensions are rising between Lebanon and Israel. One reader wants to know: If Lebanon gets involved, how big a force is Hezbollah compared to Hamas?Hugo Bachega, reporting from southern Lebanon, says:Hezbollah - a Lebanese military, political, and social movement - has long been seen by Israel as a more formidable force than Hamas.The heavily armed Iranian-backed group has an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Most of this arsenal is made up of small, man-portable and unguided surface-to-surface artillery rockets.But it also includes anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel.This is much more sophisticated than what Hamas has at its disposal.Hezbollah's leader has claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates vary between 20,000 and 50,000. Many are well trained and battle hardened, and have fought in the Syrian civil war.Hamas, by comparison, has an estimated 30,000 fighters, according to Israel.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,3 days ago,"Home to 2.2 million people, the Gaza Strip is a densely-populated enclave, 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders.In response to Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, Israel has begun a ""complete siege"" of Gaza, with the Israeli defence minister declaring: ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel"".The move immediately worsened the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 80% of the population was already in need of international aid.Gaza has been under the control of the militant Islamist group Hamas since 2007, following a violent conflict with the then governing Palestinian Authority.Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. Israel withdrew its troops and about 7,000 settlers in 2005, but even before the current blockade it restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza.As part of its response to the Hamas attack, Israel has told civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of an expected invasion by the Israeli military.The evacuation area includes Gaza City - the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip.The Erez border crossing into Israel is closed, so those living in the evacuation zone are unable to leave Gaza and have no choice but to head towards the southern districts.With 2.2 million people in a relatively small strip of land, Gaza has one of the highest population densities in the world.The largest urban area in the south is Khan Younis, but with a population half the size of Gaza City's it will struggle to cope with a million Palestinians fleeing the north.On average, there are more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London - but that figure was more than 9,000 in Gaza City, the most heavily populated area.According to the United Nations, following the evacuation order the number of displaced people has risen rapidly and there are now 1.4 million who have fled their homes since 7 October.Israel's airstrikes on Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October have caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure.The map below shows areas which have been affected using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University.More than 5,000 structures in North Gaza alone have been either destroyed or damaged some way - about 15% of all buildings in the region - according to preliminary reports by Unosat, which also provides satellite analysis during humanitarian disasters.The neighbourhood of Beit Hanoun, near the north-eastern border with Israel, has suffered significant damage since the start of the conflict, with dozens of buildings hit, including a school compound.Beit Hanoun's residents were among the first to be issued warnings by Israel to leave their homes. Israeli aircraft subsequently delivered waves of airstrikes on the area - which IDF described as a hub for Hamas and ""from which many operations against Israel were launched"".Satellite analysis also shows destruction of residential areas, school buildings and mosques in Beit Lahiya, Jabalia and areas of Gaza City - one of the most densely populated places in the world.Unosat said it had also identified dozens of agricultural greenhouses that had been damaged or destroyed and fields peppered with visible impact craters. More than 270 road sections also look like they have been affected by craters or debris.Israel ordered Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza and move south of the area known as Wadi Gaza. But the satellite analysis shows strikes have also destroyed buildings there, with damage in Khan Younis, Rafah and rural areas near the south-eastern border.The repeated conflicts between Palestinian militants and Israel have left many people in Gaza without adequate housing.Extended families live in overcrowded, low-quality, insecure buildings, with the Norwegian Refugee Council estimating that more than 120,000 are living in homes that have no windows, safe roofs or doors.Palestinian officials say the current Israeli air strikes have destroyed around a thousand homes - adding to 2,200 yet to be rebuilt from previous conflicts since 2014.Another 72,000 which were damaged but not destroyed had not received any financial help with repairs.The loss of those homes compounds the ongoing shortage of housing in Gaza. The Global Shelter Cluster estimates that 120,000 units need to be built in Gaza to provide everyone with shelter.Just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before the evacuation order, according to the UN.Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose ""place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War"". The children of Palestinian refugees are also able to apply for refugee status.More than 500,000 of those refugees were already in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.As two of those camps, Jabalia and Shati, are in the evacuation zone, this has put the other six under increased pressure and many people are being forced to sleep outdoors.Gaza is without electricity with its sole power plant closed and supplies from Israel suspended.The Gaza Power Plant, in Deir al-Balah just south of the evacuation area, shut down on 11 October after running out of fuel.Even before the current conflict power cuts were an everyday occurrence in Gaza, with households receiving electricity for only 13 hours per day on average, according to the UN.Major institutions, like hospitals, have back-up generators but the blockade means no fuel to run them once existing supplies run out.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says without electricity hospitals in Gaza ""risk turning into morgues.""Israel was immediately blamed by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian authorities after an explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on 17 October that is feared to have killed hundreds of people. Israel has denied being involved.However, many medical facilities are in the evacuation zone in the north and have been damaged by Israeli airstrikes.The World Health Organization (WHO) says there have been more than one hundred attacks on healthcare facilities and the majority of hospitals in Gaza are not functioning.Public health facilities in Gaza were already overstretched with shortages of medical supplies and equipment and many specialist treatments were not available.Patients from Gaza needing life-saving or advanced care in West Bank or East Jerusalem hospitals needed approval by the Palestinian Authority and then exit passes from the Israeli authorities.From 2008 to 2022, more than 70,000 or a third of patient permit applications were delayed or denied. Some patients also died while awaiting a response to their application.The tap water in Gaza is salty and polluted and was already considered unfit for drinking - Israel has now cut off much of its supply of clean water.The WHO sets the minimum requirement for daily water needs at 100 litres per person - to cover drinking, washing, cooking and bathing. Before the conflict, the average consumption in Gaza was about 84 litres, with only 27 litres of that considered suitable for human use.Currently, the WHO estimates the average water consumption in Gaza is just three litres per person.There are increasing concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases with the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA warning that ""people will start dying without water"".Only one of the three water mains into Gaza is thought to be open - providing limited drinking water to Khan Younis in the south.Local water pumps and sewage systems need fuel to function. As a result, wastewater treatment plants have stopped working, leading to tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage being pumped daily into the sea.Meanwhile, at least six water wells, three water pumping stations, one reservoir, and one desalination plant, have been all been damaged by airstrikes, cutting the supply to more than half a million people.Civilians have little hope of being able to leave Gaza to escape the conflict.Before the attack by Hamas, there were only two crossings allowing travel into and out of Gaza - with most former border points having been closed for years.Palestinians are banned from leaving Gaza via Israel unless they obtain an Israeli-issued exit permit. The permits were limited to day labourers, businesspeople, medical patients and their companions, and aid workers.The entire 60km-long border with Israel is guarded by a perimeter fence with ""no-go"" areas extending up to 100m (330ft) from the fence itself and only farm workers are allowed within 300m.Those wanting to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt had to register with the Palestinian authorities several weeks in advance and apply to Egypt, which imposes limits on numbers and severe security controls.Now Israel has indefinitely shut the Erez crossing, while the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing in the south has been closed due to Israeli airstrikes near the gate on the Palestinian side.The latter had prevented humanitarian aid, including food, water and medicines, crossing from Egypt into Gaza. On Saturday, the border opened for the first time since the conflict began. Israel has agreed to allow around 20 trucks carrying food, water and medicine - but no fuel - into Gaza.To try to get round the blockade, Hamas has built a network of tunnels which it uses to bring goods into the Strip from Egypt and also as an underground command centre.Israel says the tunnels are also used by militants to smuggle weapons and move around out of sight. It frequently targets them with airstrikes.Gaza has one of the world's youngest populations, with almost 60% of the population under 25 years old, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.That compares with just over 20% in London, where according to data from the 2021 census, more than 65% of people are aged between 25 and 64.More than 80% of the population lives in poverty in Gaza, where unemployment levels are among the highest in the world, reaching 45% in 2022.Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

BBC,2 hours ago,"This video can not be playedYocheved Lifschitz shook the hand of her Hamas captor as she left""I went through hell,"" says Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother and peace activist released by Hamas on Monday after two weeks in captivity.Ms Lifschitz and her husband were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen on motorbikes and taken into a ""spider's web"" of tunnels underneath Gaza, she said.She described being hit by sticks on the journey, but said most of the hostages were being ""treated well"".She was freed alongside another woman, Nurit Cooper, 79, on Monday evening.Extraordinary images show the grandmother shaking the hand of a Hamas gunman, just seconds before she was handed over to the International Red Cross at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and neighbouring Egypt.""Shalom,"" she appears to say to the gunman - the Hebrew word for peace.Ms Lifschitz was kidnapped, alongside her husband Oded, from Nir Oz Kibbutz in southern Israel on 7 October. He has not been released.It was early in the morning when Hamas attacked their kibbutz, massacring the small community. One in four residents are believed to have been killed or kidnapped, including many children.Speaking at a news conference from Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv just a few hours after her release, Ms Lifschitz explained what happened after she was kidnapped.She said he was hit with sticks during the journey into Gaza, and suffered bruises and breathing difficulties.This video can not be playedPeace activist Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, says she was beaten as she was driven into GazaHer daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, who helped translate her mother's ordeal to reporters, said the 85-year-old was forced to walk for a few kilometres on wet ground.Sharone said her mother was taken into ""a huge network of tunnels underneath Gaza that looked like a spider's web"".Ms Lifschitz said she was among 25 hostages taken into the tunnels and after several hours, five people from her kibbutz, including herself, were taken into a separate room. There, they each had a guard and access to a paramedic and doctor.She described clean conditions inside, with mattresses on the floor for them to sleep on. Another captive who was badly injured in a motorbike accident on the way into Gaza was treated for his injuries by a doctor.""They made sure we wouldn't get sick, and we had a doctor with us every two or three days.""She also said they had access to medicines they needed and there were women there who knew about ""feminine hygiene"".They ate the same food - pitta bread with cheese and cucumber - as the Hamas guards, her daughter Sharone added.Asked by a reporter why she had shaken hands with the gunman, Ms Lifschitz said the hostage takers had treated her well and the remaining hostages were in good condition.Sharone said she wasn't surprised by her mother's gesture - ""the way she walked off and then came back and then said thank you was quite incredible to me. It's so her,"" she earlier told the BBC.Hours before Ms Lifschitz and Nurit Cooper were released on Monday evening, the Israeli military held a screening for journalists showing raw footage recovered from Hamas body cameras, in an effort to remind the world of the brutality of the attack on Israel two weeks ago.Among the clips was footage of Hamas gunmen cheering with apparent joy as they shot civilians on the road, and later stalking the pathways of kibbutzim and killing parents and children in their homes.More than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack.Ms Lifschitz and her 83-year-old husband, Oded, are known peace activists who helped transport sick people out of Gaza to hospitals in Israel, according to their families.Oded is a journalist who's worked for peace and the rights of Palestinians for decades, Sharone told the BBC.According to the National Union of Journalists, he used to work for newspaper Al Hamishmar, and was among the first journalists to report on the massacre in two Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut in 1982.""He speaks good Arabic so can communicate very well with the people there. He knows many people in Gaza. I want to think he's going to be OK,"" says Sharone.In total, four hostages have now been released, after two American-Israelis, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan, were freed on Friday.Israel says more than 200 people are still being held hostage. The husband of Nurit Cooper, who was also freed on Monday night, is believed to be among them.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,19 hours ago,"Yosef Guedalia has been named as another British-Israeli killed by Hamas in the 7 October attack.The 22-year-old soldier was part of an anti-terror unit when he was killed confronting Hamas gunmen at Kibbutz Kfar Aza.His brother Asher said he ""literally saved people minutes before he got shot"".He added that Yosef had helped evacuate injured civilians before returning to fight Hamas.Asher said there is a video of Yosef carrying out an injured civilian who is now recovering in hospital.""He acted with heroism and determination, he continued to fight and didn't think of himself or hesitate…He went in to rescue as many citizens as possible before they got murdered in their homes and to kill as many terrorists as he could,"" Asher said.He added that Yosef was ""always happy, there was no bad in him"", adding he was ""a righteous and good person"".Yosef's mother was born in Manchester, and he was about to celebrate his first wedding anniversary.""I'm sure he understood he might not get back to his wife and his family but that's his calling. That's the hero we had for 22 years,"" Asher said.His grandfather Isidore Zuckerbrod, whose parents survived the Holocaust, told the PA news agency that Yosef returned to the kibbutz four times while under fire to rescue hostages.On his fourth journey, his armoured vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and he was shot as he fled, his grandfather said.Israeli soldiers shot the men who were dragging Yosef's body away in an effort to use him as a ""dead hostage"", he said.

BBC,1 day ago,"Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned Israel that the Middle East could spiral out of control if it does not stop strikes on Gaza.He said the US was also ""to blame"" for providing military support to Israel.Hours later, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu warned troops his people were in a battle for their lives and said the war against Hamas was ""do or die"".Iran supports both Hamas, which attacked Israel two weeks ago killing 1,400 people, and Lebanon's Hezbollah.More than 4,600 Palestinians have been killed in the last two weeks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and Israel announced on Saturday that it was intensifying air strikes.""I warn the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control,"" Mr Amir-Abdollahian said at a news conference in Tehran.He said that the results could be ""severe, bitter"" and ""have far-reaching repercussions"", both regionally and for those advocating for war.The foreign minister added that US military support for Israel was evidence that the ongoing conflict in Gaza was ""a proxy war carried out by Israel on behalf of the United States"".Top US officials are also warning the conflict could spread.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned of the prospect of ""significant escalation of attacks"" on US troops or citizens.""If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation... our advice is: don't,"" he said on the ABC network's This Week programme.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also mentioned a ""likelihood of escalation"" from Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah or Hamas, and said the US was ""taking every measure to make sure we can defend"" Israelis and US citizens.Several Iraqi bases used by US-led coalition troops have been targeted in drone and rocket attacks in recent days.Also on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu paid a visit to troops in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon, which has seen exchanges of fire with Hezbollah since the early days of the conflict.""We're in a battle for our lives. A battle for our home, this is not an exaggeration, this is the war. It's do or die - they need to die,"" he said.He warned Hezbollah not to enter the war.""[Hezbollah] will be making the biggest mistake of their lives. And we will hit them with an unimaginable force. It will mean devastation for them and the state of Lebanon,"" he said.For its part, Hezbollah has declared that it is ""fully ready to fight against Israel"".At least 27 people have been reported killed in southern Lebanon during exchanges of fire between Israel and Hamas. At least five Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed in Israel, according to Israeli military reports.Israel has ordered dozens of northern communities to evacuate, adding 14 more on Sunday.And in neighbouring Syria - where Iran has a military presence - Israeli missiles hit Damascus and Aleppo international airports early on Sunday, killing at least two workers, according to Syrian state media.Both airports have been taken out of use given the damage to their runways.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,3 days ago,"The anguish over some 200 people kidnapped by Hamas in its brutal attack on Israel is in the spotlight - but Hamas has been holding at least two Israelis for years.Very little has been heard about Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengistu and Bedouin Arab Israeli Hisham al-Sayed, seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively.The relatives of two dead Israeli soldiers are also tormented by the fact that Hamas has been holding their remains in Gaza since 2014. Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul were killed during a war between Israel and Hamas that year.Hamas - backed by Iran and regarded by Western nations as a terrorist group - has previously demanded a high price for releasing captive Israelis. They are used as Hamas bargaining chips.Aviram Shaul, brother of Oron, says that for nearly 10 years his family has had no news from Hamas about where it is keeping Oron's body, no sign that Oron will be returned.In 2014 the army found Oron's helmet and bulletproof vest in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza. But since then, Aviram told the BBC, ""I feel Israelis forgot about them [the two dead soldiers]"".""Now is a good chance to bring my brother back, because we're talking about 200 families with relatives held hostage in Gaza. The government did not do enough to bring my brother back, but now they have to make a big effort.""He said now ""Israel needs to do a humanitarian deal to get the hostages out"". ""If Hamas wants electricity, water, they must give us the hostages and soldiers' bodies and Israel does nothing if they don't want to.""After secret negotiations in 2011 Israel got the abducted soldier Gilad Shalit back - but in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners held in its jails.Israel is now determined to wipe out Hamas and is inflicting huge casualties and damage on Gaza with air strikes. So any new prisoner swap would be both difficult and controversial. As the Gaza death toll mounts, Palestinian fury at Israel intensifies.Hagai Hadas, formerly an Israeli military commander and Mossad intelligence officer, played a key role in negotiating Shalit's release.He told the BBC that such prisoner deals with Palestinian kidnappers were ""a political issue"" and in the current emergency, with so much Israeli anger directed at Hamas, ""it's not going to happen, it's impossible"".He stressed that the controversial Shalit swap was possible politically for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the time - he felt secure enough - and the deal had been finalised two years before Shalit's release.""Now I think the price won't be Hamas prisoners - it's to be paid using different tools,"" Mr Hadas said.He stressed that Israel now had various options: direct military rescues if the intelligence on the captives' locations was precise; use of ""economic assets"" - that is, payment; humanitarian options; or ""to let Hamas leaders escape from Gaza, say to Qatar"".On the latter option, he said, ""you have to put them under stress, give them the idea that to save their lives they can make such a deal"".""I believe the majority [of hostages] are in Hamas hands, but several are not. I'm almost sure that Israel is making every effort to locate them and try to bring them out by military means.""He said that ""even in a full-scale war in Gaza, Israel will push for a deal to get the hostages released, it will try to the last second to find a solution"". ""We value life and are willing to pay for life.""The two Israeli civilian hostages held by Hamas since 2014 ""were not kidnapped"", Mr Hadas said, but ""they went to Gaza, they were not mentally fit"". ""It's a big difference - we've had nothing similar to what we experienced on 7 October,"" he said, referring to the massacre by Hamas.Hamas claims that Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed are soldiers, but official Israeli documents seen by Human Rights Watch show that both are civilians who were exempted from military service.Tila Fenta has led a campaign to get Avera released and feels let down by the Israeli state - though she says the international spotlight on Gaza hostages now might help her cause.""I want to believe that the chances for Avera have improved, but I say that in all sorrow,"" she told the BBC. She stressed that ""we are still in shock - all Israelis are"" since the Hamas attack and mass hostage-taking that killed about 1,400 Israelis.She said the campaigners felt ""devastated"" by Israel's failure for all these years to secure the return of Avera and Hisham.""They're not soldiers, both are sick - they have mental issues - and Hamas captured them against all humanity,"" she said.She linked the lack of progress over Avera and Hisham to their disadvantaged background and discrimination in Israeli society towards Ethiopian Jews and Bedouin Arabs.""I think Avera is a man who society doesn't like so much, because of his colour, mental illness problem and having grown up in a poor area of Ashkelon.""I think all this made him not wanted in society. If he was a bit brighter, or from a good area the treatment would be different. I know this isn't the time to say something wrong about my country, but the truth must be told."" She said big human rights organisations should also have done more. ""The same goes for the Bedouin - both are disadvantaged.""A third young Israeli citizen, Jumaa Abu Ghanima, is believed to have crossed into Gaza in 2016 and is still missing. A Bedouin Arab, like Hisham, he may be in Hamas hands, but there is no confirmation.Before illegally entering the Gaza Strip, both Avera and Hisham had gone missing repeatedly, and had had psychiatric treatment, Human Rights Watch research shows.In January Hamas released a short undated video clip of a man who mumbled in Hebrew: ""I am the captive Avera Mengistu. For how much longer will I remain in captivity with my friends."" The Mengistu family confirmed his identity, the Free Avera campaign told the BBC.Prime Minister Netanyahu told Avera's mother Agurnesh that the government had ""confirmation"" that her son was still alive. He said Israel ""does not stop its efforts to return Avera Mengistu and the rest of our captives and missing persons"".In June 2022 Hamas released a video showing Hisham al-Sayed in captivity. Hisham's father Shaaban al-Sayed confirmed his identity.Hamas said only that Hisham's health had deteriorated - no more details were given. He could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.Tzur Goldin, brother of the late Hadar Goldin, whose remains are still in Gaza, has urged Israel to adopt a clear policy to tackle Hamas kidnapping.""Kidnapping is directed against families and is designed to break up societies. We have become accustomed to a certain security situation, to a certain conduct. We have become accustomed to it being convenient for the captives and the missing to be on the sidelines,"" he said, quoted by Israel National News - Arutz Sheva.""There is a round of fighting, followed by silence, followed by another round and more silence.""Freeing any of the Hamas hostages looks likely to be a messy, controversial affair. ""It's a dilemma everywhere in doing deals with terrorists,"" Hagai Hadas told the BBC. ""You have contradictory options, they can be good or bad.""© 2023 BBC.

BBC,21 hours ago,"This video can not be playedInside the Gaza hospital overwhelmed by the injuredSome Palestinians who fled their homes in the north of Gaza are starting to return because of the dire situation in the south, a senior UN official says.Israel told 1.1 million residents of Gaza City and other northern areas to leave for their own safety last week.But the UN official said they were struggling to find shelter, food and drinking water in the south.The Hamas-run health ministry also said hundreds had been killed there in Israeli air strikes over the past day.The Israeli military said it had hit hundreds of military targets belonging to Hamas across Gaza, as it stepped up its air campaign ahead of an expected ground offensive.More than 5,000 people are now reported to have been killed across the Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its bombardment in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 taken hostage.Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.The UN estimates that almost two thirds of Gaza's population - 1.4 million people - have fled their homes over the past two weeks either out of fear or because their homes have been destroyed or damaged.The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Khan Younis says the southern city has been overwhelmed by the influx of between 600,000 and 700,000 displaced people, with many sheltering inside hospitals, clubs and restaurants, or even forced to sleep in the streets.The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that most displaced people were living off just 1 litre (34 fl oz) of water and one or two small rounds of Arabic bread a day.The humanitarian crisis, combined with continued strikes on civilian areas in the south, meant that ""some people are going back to the north"", he said.""Essentially, people have left everything in the north - their houses, their businesses, their lives. They've come to the south where they are struggling to find shelter, food is scarce, many people are having to drink unpotable water, so the situation in the south is dire.""Riyad Jaabas, a displaced man staying in Khan Younis, told Reuters news agency: ""We were expelled from Gaza City. They said Khan Younis is a safe area, now there is no safe space in all Gaza.""On Saturday, leaflets dropped over Gaza City by the Israeli military warned that anyone who did not move south of the Wadi Gaza river ""might be identified as an accomplice in a terrorist organisation"".And although the UN welcomed the arrival of 34 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies over the weekend, Mr White warned that hundreds more a day were required to meet Gaza's needs, particularly those carrying fuel.""Before the conflict Gaza was receiving about 455 trucks a day, so we've got a long way to go to scale up the logistics operation.""""We have about three days left of fuel inside Gaza,"" he added ""This is something that Israel needs to allow to enter Gaza, otherwise our aid operation will come to a halt. Desalinization plants will start running out of water. Hospitals will start having to shut down their wards.""Gaza's health ministry warned that the generators at 13 public hospitals were running out of fuel and that they were only running the most essential life-saving services, including incubators helping to keep 130 babies alive.Israel is refusing to allow fuel in, saying it could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes.An Israeli defence ministry agency said on Sunday that Hamas had ""a fuel reserve of 1 million litres"". It accused the group of ""refusing to hand [fuel] out to facilities in need"" and using it for ""lighting up their terror tunnels, for rocket launchers, and for their own homes"".This video can not be playedWatch: Life in Gaza - From lead singer to being homeless and seeking shelterOn Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that its forces had struck 320 targets in Gaza over the past day, including ""tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres... military compounds, and observation posts"".""Furthermore, the IDF struck targets that posed a threat to forces in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip who are preparing for ground operations, including dozens of mortar shell and anti-tank missile launch posts,"" it added.Overnight, videos shared on social media showed the blasts of successive Israeli strikes on Gaza lighting up the sky.The director of the Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that there were 10 strikes within 100m (330ft) of the facility, where there were 500 patients and another 1,500 people taking shelter.On Monday afternoon, Gaza's health ministry said 436 people, including 182 children, had been killed in the past 24 hours, most of them in the south.The ministry also announced that the overall death toll in Gaza since Israel began responding to Hamas's cross-border attack had risen to 5,087.The figure includes 471 people who the health ministry said were killed by an explosion at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City. Hamas blamed an Israeli air strike, but the IDF presented evidence that it said showed the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.On Monday, the UK government said it had also assessed that the explosion was ""likely caused by a missile or part of one that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel"", echoing the conclusions of the US, France and Canada.The IDF says 7,000 rockets have been fired towards Israel by Hamas and other groups in Gaza since 7 October, with 550 failing and landing inside Gaza.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,21 hours ago,"This video can not be playedRishi Sunak updates MPs on UK analysis of Al-Ahli hospital explosionRishi Sunak says the UK has judged that the blast at Gaza's Al-Ahli hospital was likely caused by ""a missile, or part of one"" fired from ""within Gaza"".The PM said the conclusion was based on the ""deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts"".Media outlets, including the BBC, reported an initial Hamas statement blaming Israel for Tuesday's explosion.Israel denied this shortly afterwards, saying that it was caused by a misfiring rocket from within Gaza.Mr Sunak told the House of Commons: ""On the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapons experts, the British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile, or part of one, that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel.""Mr Sunak said that ""misreporting"" of the blast had had a ""negative effect in the region"".""We need to learn the lessons and ensure that in future there is no rush to judgement,"" he said.Regional leaders cancelled a meeting with US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the explosion.Mr Biden has since backed the Israeli assessment of the incident.Mr Sunak also said the UK would give a further £20 million of humanitarian aid to Gaza, doubling its earlier funding.He said Palestinians were suffering, and called them ""victims of Hamas"".He added that ""we need to invest more deeply in regional stability and in the two-state solution"" to the conflict, which would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.The prime minister said there  was""no scenario"" where Hamas could be allowed to ""control Gaza or any part of the Palestinian territories"".He also made mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""It is a same motivation that drives [Vladimir] Putin's war on Ukraine, the fear of Ukraine's emergence as a modern, thriving democracy and a desire to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past. Putin will fail and so will Hamas,"" he said.He also condemned the use of the word ""jihad"" at a pro-Palestinian protest in London over the weekend. A video posted online appeared to show a man shouting the word at a separate event from the main pro-Palestine march.""Calls for jihad on our streets are not only a threat to the Jewish community but to our democratic values and we expect the police to take all necessary action to tackle extremism head-on,"" he said.This video can not be playedInside the Gaza hospital overwhelmed by the injuredOpposition leader Keir Starmer said humanitarian corridors must be established for civilians in Gaza trying to escape violence.He said basic human needs like water, food and medicine must not be denied to people who need them.""Gaza needs aid and it needs to be rapid, safe, unhindered and regular,"" he said.The first aid convoys reached Gaza through the border with Egypt over the weekend - 20 lorries on Saturday and 14 on Sunday.The UN said much more was needed and the Rafah border crossing is still not open for foreign nationals seeking to flee Gaza.Israel says that more than 1,400 people were killed when Hamas attacked communities near Gaza on 7 October, shooting civilians dead in their homes, in the streets and at a music festival.Gaza's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the enclave.At least 10 British nationals were among those killed in the Hamas attacks.Yosef Guedalia, 22, is the latest British-Israeli named as being killed by Hamas.

BBC,22 hours ago,"Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find disturbingAs Tsachi Idan was driven away to Gaza, his hands were still covered with his daughter's blood.He wasn't allowed to wash them after cradling 18-year-old Maayan, who was murdered in front of her family by a Hamas gunman.Nor was he able to wipe them clean before he used his body to shelter his two youngest children, as the sound of explosions ripped through the air outside their home.And throughout the ordeal, Hamas rigged up a phone to broadcast the family's pain and terror to the world on Facebook Live.Gali Idan, Tsachi's wife, is now far away from their beloved Nahal Oz, one of the many southern Israeli communities attacked by Hamas on 7 October.She and her surviving children are being looked after in a different kibbutz, surrounded by care and comfort. But it isn't home.Home is the place the family had lived in since Maayan was four years old. It's the house where they'd grown and made memories together, and where her younger brother and sisters had been born.Maayan, the eldest child, was mature, and shy. ""She was perfect,"" their neighbour told me. She had just passed her driving test, and had her first boyfriend. She loved to read, and asked for books for her birthday just four days before she was killed. As Gali says, now, she'll forever be 18.Sitting in a shaded spot underneath the citrus trees, Gali says she doesn't want to recount the pain of that day - it's too raw - but she's doing it for Tsachi.""I want him back. Whole, and alive. I want him back now.""On 7 October, the family woke to the sound of red alert alarms, warning of rocket fire from Gaza. They knew what to do. But that morning, something was different.""It was unusual and very intense,"" Gali tells me. ""It was a barrage. Barrage after barrage. We couldn't even go out and breathe. We closed ourselves in the mamad, our sheltered room inside our home.""""Tsachi and I looked at each other and said that something here isn't right. Something was horrifying.""We got messages on the internal system of the kibbutz that we were under attack, and that we needed to stay inside the mamad. At some point they told us to be quiet, that there was likely an infiltration of terrorists within the kibbutz,"" she continued.""You need to understand that this is something that was never an option, ever. It was always the nightmare of nightmares, but there was always a solution from the state or the security forces to that situation. And suddenly, it was real. The nightmare was real.""Gali describes how - at that moment - something exploded outside the house, shattering the glass windows. Then came the sound of footsteps and voices inside their home. A man shouted in accented English, ""we don't shoot"".But they did.""Tsachi held onto the door and didn't let them open it,"" Gali continues. ""There's no lock on it and the kids are screaming and there's crazy chaos inside the room. It's dark, but then Maayan understood.""""She saw that they were able to open the door just a bit. And so she jumped up and helped Tsachi to grab the door.""Gali's tears start to fall, but she keeps on describing that moment.""They're screaming 'we don't shoot', and then they shot. Tsachi yelled 'who's been hit, who's been hit?' And it was Maayan. She fell next to him, and then Hamas were able to open the door. There were screams, and they turned on the light.""""Maayan was in a huge puddle of blood. I checked her and realised she'd been hit in the head, and she was critically wounded. They yelled to us to get out of the mamad. We just told the kids 'don't look', and I led them out.""""A war is going on around my house, and they are inside.""In their nightwear, Tsachi, Gali and their two youngest children Yael, 11, and Shachar, 9, sat on the floor as the sound of gunfire echoed around them. One of their captors picked up Gali's phone, asked for her password, and began filming the family on Facebook Live.The video is painful to watch. For more than 26 minutes, the family are seen crouching low as more rocket sirens sound and the Hamas attack continues. The children jump in fright at the volleys of fire, and sob in their parents' arms. All the while, Maayan's lifeless body is lying just metres away.""To my fortune, my kids are brave in a way that cannot be described,"" says Gali. ""They talked to the terrorists, I don't know how they could. They asked them why they are here, and why they shoot and why they kill. Maybe that's what saved us?""""And Tsachi is broken. He saw his daughter die, he saw her getting shot in the head and die next to him. His daughter that had just celebrated her 18th birthday. The house is full of balloons, and congratulations, and… and blood.""Eventually, Tsachi is told to get up. His hands are cuffed behind his back with a cable tie. The children scream at Hamas not to take their dad, not to kill him. And then he's driven away.Sharon, Gali's second eldest daughter who was away in Tel Aviv when the attack took place, comforts her mother as she speaks of her ordeal.The 15-year-old managed to speak to her father on the phone during the attack. ""Sharon, we're in a mess, I will call you later. I love you,"" Tsachi said, and hung up. It was the last time they talked. Gali's last words to her husband are burned into her mind too.""When he left the house I told him ""I love you, don't be a hero, be smart. Take care of yourself, and come back to me in one piece. That's it. And now I want him to return to me, in one piece, and well,"" says Gali.""Tsachi has to be here and to mourn his daughter. I need to hug him.""Israel has now identified more than 200 people who are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Across Israel and around the world, families are devastated.""I don't understand what their goal is,"" says Gali.""They want to show themselves as monsters? There you go. You are monsters. You are the worst nightmare that our children can have. You are terror. There's no way to define it. It's awful. I don't know how long this scar is going to last. But they must bring the civilians back. They must bring them all back.""At another kibbutz, far from home, Maayan's coffin sits in a peaceful spot in front of rows of chairs.There aren't enough seats to hold the hundreds of mourners who arrive to remember her, holding wreaths and bunches of colourful flowers.Friends and family make speeches and share memories of a young woman who loved playing volleyball, and loved life.Gali speaks to the assembled crowd, remembering her daughter. When she isn't at the microphone, she's holding her surviving children tightly.Yael and Shachar, at just 11 and 9, have seen such horrors that their small faces crumple into tears again and again. Their sister is dead, and their father isn't here to comfort them.Tsachi's absence is felt everywhere. Gali says she wants the world to know his name. Any small thing that might help to get him released, she's ready to do.Many of the mourners wear T-shirts with his and Maayan's pictures on the front. The words ""kidnapped father"" and ""murdered daughter"" appear above their faces, family photos from a happier time. On the reverse is a simple and powerful message, ""bring Tsachi back"".In this unimaginable darkness, his family needs him.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

BBC,23 hours ago,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 220 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages.More than 5,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israeli troops have also massed along the Gaza boundary and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a major ground operation.Israel has also cut off electricity and most water and stopped imports of food and medicine, although it has allowed in several dozen aid lorries through Egypt's Rafah crossing since Saturday.Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One.The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups.Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people.This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community.The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922.To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two.Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased.In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city.That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews.Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the ""Catastrophe""By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza.Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live.Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt.Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years.Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements.Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel.There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on.These include:Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence.A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton.In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up.Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal.The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995.In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented.Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington.The most recent peace plan - prepared by the US when Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities.Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack.But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons.The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition.It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war.Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East.Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack.Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, denied any involvement.© 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Both are now shut.""We've experienced bombing and planes flying over us, buildings destroyed, all sorts of horrible things,"" she said.""I hope we get through to Egypt today.""Ms Abuaassi said her family had temporarily moved into a relative's flat in Khan Younis for a week, where 43 people were staying.She hopes that the family's British passports will help them get across the border.""I feel very sorry for the people of Gaza who are not able to leave and are stuck here,"" she said.""I just hope [there is help for]  these people who have been left behind.""People now don't have anywhere to live and are homeless. I just hope these people get help.""One of her children recalled how the family had to run from their home in the middle of the night.""Many buildings near us had been bombed,"" he said, adding they later found refuge in a hospital.""In the hospital when I was there, I saw people crying, people's hands broken, women crying.""I saw someone in shock - they were shaking - from the bombs.""Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

BBC,1 day ago,"Fifteen Labour officers have resigned over party rules about responding to the conflict in Gaza.Nine officers in a Glasgow ward, including a Labour peer, and six in Edinburgh stood down.The Glasgow Kelvin officers accused Scottish Labour of ""stifling democracy"" after a motion calling for an end to military action was ruled out of order.Scottish Labour said it condemned Hamas's actions and the collective punishment of Palestinian people.In Glasgow's Kelvin Labour Party, chairman Jim Mackechnie and Labour Peer Baroness Bryan resigned alongside seven others including the secretary, policy officer and trades union liaison officer.They had submitted a motion urging Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar to call for a cessation of Israeli military action, the establishment of a humanitarian corridor and the release of hostages.In a letter of resignation they said: ""We have been informed by the general secretary and the Scottish general secretary that any motions relating to the situation in Israel and Gaza are out of order for all CLPs.""It said they were being ""forced to shut down discussion"", and they refused to be ""part of a party machinery which stifles democracy"".Six members of the Edinburgh Northern and Leith Executive Committee also stood down.A statement from the party said: ""Scottish Labour has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the actions of Hamas. There is no justification for the loss of innocent life and the targeting of civilians.""Every life should be treated equally and so there should be no collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""It added: ""The Labour Party continues to believe strongly in the cause of peace in the region through a two-state solution that delivers security, peace and freedom for all through a sovereign state of Israel and a sovereign state of Palestine with an end to occupation and the siege.""Over the past 10 days eight Labour councillors in Oxford have quit the party over comments from Sir Keir Starmer on the Israel-Hamas war, losing the party its majority in the city council.The Palestinian militant group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostage.Gaza's health ministry said more than 4,600 people had been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes to weaken Hamas.Coll McCail, a young members representative on Labour's Scottish Executive Committee (SEC), told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the labour leadership was out of step with the British public, after a recent poll showed more than 70% supported a ceasefire.""I think the UK Labour leadership have failed continually to show leadership in this situation to oppose the UK government in their outright support for Israel as it launches an inhuman offensive against the people of Gaza,"" he said.He said Labour members resigning over this issue would be detrimental in the run up to a general election campaign.""If it's the case as we've seen in Edinburgh and Glasgow that members are taking action and resigning their position over this issue, then it is detrimental not just to the party's reputation but materially in the run up a general election campaign.""He said Sir Keir had failed to show solidarity with the people of Palestine who had been ""under siege for decades"".Mr McCail said Mr Sarwar had already ""deviated"" from the UK Labour general secretary's advice that Labour's elected representatives should not attend demonstrations.Scottish Labour sent MSP Pauline Mc Neill to speak at a demonstration attended by thousands of people in Glasgow on Saturday.She told the crowd she spoke for Scottish Labour, who wanted to be part of a growing movement across the world demanding an end of a ""cycle of murderous violence in the region"", the release of ""all Israeli hostages without delay"", and the ""cessation of the revenge war on the people in Gaza"".Ms McNeill said she had seen the ""daily suffering of the ordinary people of Gaza"" on visits to the region and railed against the Israeli government's actions, adding ""no mother, Jewish, Israeli or Palestinian should be unable to protect their children from death"".Former Labour adviser John McTernan told Good Morning Scotland the Labour party was justified in asking elected members to follow long-standing party rules.""The motion was to press for Israel's military action to stop. That's not a ceasefire, that's militarily standing down,"" he said, adding Hamas was not offering a ceasefire.""You can't have a ceasefire without both sides agreeing.""He added: ""Hamas seek to sow division.""The right end point in this, as Scottish Labour said, is a two-state solution. Hamas do not want a two-state solution, they want a one state solution, a state of Palestine without Israel.""We have to work hard on moving toward peace, but in the meantime humanitarian support is absolutely critical.""Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf has said his mother-in-law and her husband were living through ""torture"" as they remain stuck in Gaza.Their family was down to six bottles of clean drinking water in a home now accommodating 100 people, he said.Israel, which normally supplies less than 10% of Gaza's water but about a third of the clean drinking water, has cut off supplies during the conflict.Mr Yousaf said he was pleading with the UK government to demand the opening of Egypt's Rafah crossing and a ceasefire.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,1 day ago,"Twelve British nations were killed in Hamas's surprise attack on Israel on 7 October, the UK government has said.A further five are missing, some of whom are feared dead or are being held hostage in Gaza.The stories of those who have lost their lives are still emerging. These are the victims we have learned about so far.British-Israeli soldier Yosef Guedalia was part of an Israel Defense Forces unit sent to confront Hamas gunmen at Kibbutz Kfar Aza.His brother Asher said he ""literally saved people minutes before he got shot"" and described him as a ""righteous and good person"".He said Yosef had helped to evacuate injured people and was killed after returning to fight the attackers.The 22-year-old's mother was born in Manchester. He was due to celebrate his first wedding anniversary.British-Israeli Yonatan Rapoport was murdered in the Hamas attack on kibbutz Be'eri, southern Israel.The father-of-two, known to his friends as Yoni, leaves behind children Yosefi and Aluma.He was a fan of the Premier League football team Manchester United and was planning to go to Old Trafford - the team's home ground in north-west England - next month for his son's first game there.Last week, BBC News was shown messages from a WhatsApp group of mothers within Be'eri communicating as Hamas's attack on the kibbutz got under way.British-born Lianne Sharabi was found dead after the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, her family told the BBC.Her two daughters - Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13 - were missing in the days that followed. It was confirmed on 17 October that Yahel had been killed. Noiya was later confirmed dead by her family.Lianne was born in the UK but started a new life in southern Israel after marrying husband Eli. He is still missing.In a statement, their British family called Lianne the ""light of our family's life"".When confirming Noiya's death, they said she ""embraced every opportunity to help others, particularly those less fortunate than she, and was a gifted student and linguist.""Most importantly, she was an amazing granddaughter, cousin and niece. We are heartbroken she has gone, but forever grateful she was here.""The 20-year-old attended north London's JFS Jewish School before moving to Israel to serve in the military. Its headteacher said the school's community was ""devastated"" and ""heartbroken"" at the news of the death.Eliot, Mr Young's brother, told the BBC: ""Whenever I saw him, I always gave him a huge hug. And I will miss that smile. That hug and those laughs that we had together.""Mr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.A crowd of more than 1,000 people were forced to run and find cover between gravestones and under trees when air raid sirens started to sound.Bernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children, was killed in the attack.Sammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, said Mr Cowan - who was a grandfather - returned to the city often and regularly visited Mr Stein's peace advocacy stall in the city centre.He told BBC Scotland that Mr Cowan lived ""metres"" from the Gaza barrier, adding: ""It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it.""Mr Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed when it was stormed by militants.The 26-year-old was reported missing from the event, which took place near the Re'im kibbutz a few miles from the Gaza barrier.A friend told inews that he was a talented musician and DJ who was ""happy and thriving"" in Israel after relocating in 2021.He is a former pupil of north London's JFS Jewish School. When Mr Marlowe was still classed as missing, head teacher David Moody said the school community was praying for him.The family of Daniel Darlington, 34, have said they believe he is among those killed.Mr Darlington was originally from Manchester but had been living in Berlin. The photographer had been visiting friends in Israel and was travelling with a German woman.He was educated at Cheadle Hulme School, according to a memorial page.In a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and ""baby brother"". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.She wrote: ""Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life's simple pleasures.""A relative told the BBC that on the morning of 7 October, Mr Darlington was in touch with his family by text message. He was advised to lock the door and get into a shelter - but communications eventually stopped.The relative said a body was found in the room he was staying, but that he has still not been formally identified.They also said Mr Darlington had spent time in the kibbutz while in his 20s, and travelled back there each year for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.Mr Darlington had a flight to Berlin booked on the night of the attack, but had stayed longer, the relative said.The sister of Roi, Ayelet Svatitzky, said her brother was killed after Hamas's attack on Israel earlier this month.Roi, 54, was found shot dead at the back of his home, she told the BBC.""I've lost my brother, there's nothing I can do about it. All I can do is bury him,"" Ms Svatitzky said.Her other brother, 51-year-old Nadav Popplewell, and mother Channah Peri, 79, are some of those being held hostage by the Palestinian militant group.Ms Svatitzky was speaking to her mother on the phone when the gunmen entered her home. She said her mother's neighbours later told her they had seen the militants take her relatives.Roi, Mr Popplewell and Ms Svatitzky are all British citizens.(The identities of those killed are not being routinely confirmed by the UK authorities.

BBC,1 day ago,"Warning: This article contains details that some may find distressingAt the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in central Gaza, they are running out of material to cover the dead with.The bodies are stacked in a courtyard outside, prayers are said, and relatives collapse to the floor wailing in grief.Inside the hospital, doctors battle to patch up the walking wounded and save the gravely injured - but stores of medicine and supplies are dwindling by the day.A BBC Arabic reporter witnessed a facility overwhelmed with casualties where doctors were racing to finish procedures before moving on to the next patient.Some of the images which have emerged from the hospital on Sunday are too graphic to share. Children - including at least two babies - are among the dead.""We've been here since the crack of dawn and the bodies have completely filled the hospital yard, on top of the bodies which are in refrigerators which are full, inside the hospital building and outside,"" a member of staff said.""We don't have enough shrouds for the bodies because the numbers are huge. All bodies are arriving in parts, unattached and in pieces. We can't identify them because the bodies have been disfigured and crushed.""He described the situation as ""unbearable"", adding: ""Despite everything we've witnessed before, these are scenes we've never seen.""Similar scenes are being played out at hospitals across the territory as the Israel-Gaza war stretches into its third week.At the al-Quds hospital in Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa area, bombs struck nearby buildings as a team of 23 doctors and nurses treated more than 500 people, according to a message from a doctor in the hospital sent to the BBC.Patients and civilians sheltering in the hospital were living in ""a state of terror"", the doctor, who did not want to be identified for his own safety, said in a voice message.And amid a health situation he described as ""catastrophic"", doctors had to decide who to treat first. The rest join the queue.""Many of the wounded have been waiting several days for surgery,"" the doctor said. His voice message was passed on by Norwegian doctor and activist Mads Gilbert, of the Norwegian Aid Committee's emergency team.The medical staff has been depleted as some have been killed and others can't reach the site. The remaining staff now share their building with 1,200 displaced people who are sheltering there.""There are 120 wounded people with various injuries here, 10 patients are in ICU on ventilators, and we have about 400 chronic patients,"" the doctor said.""There are about 1,200 displaced citizens here - it is not easy to move such a large number of people so we decided not to evacuate.""The Israeli military has repeated its warning to everyone in the northern Gaza Strip to head south of Wadi Gaza, a strip of wetlands that winds across the territory, for their own safety. Gaza City is to the north of Wadi Gaza, while Deir al-Balah is to the south.Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to southern parts of Gaza, but thousands more remain in their homes in the north.The Hamas-controlled health authority in Gaza said dozens of people were killed in another wave of air strikes overnight on Sunday. The Israeli military said it had struck more than 320 targets in the past 24 hours, including tunnels and outposts used by Hamas and its ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Hospitals across Gaza are desperate for supplies. Three small convoys of aid have so far been able to enter Gaza. Prior to the war, about 500 aid trucks a day were entering, a spokesman from ActionAid Palestine said.Despite some food and medical supplies making it through, no fuel has entered Gaza since the conflict began. Hospitals are relying on fuel-powered generators for their electricity.On Sunday Unicef warned that 120 babies in incubators - including 70 premature newborns also on ventilators - are dependent on machines linked up to backup generators which were deployed when Gaza's electricity supply from Israel was switched off.""We have currently 120 neonates who are in incubators, out of which we have 70 neonates with mechanical ventilation, and of course this is where we are extremely concerned,"" said Unicef spokesman Jonathan Crickx.Senior figures in the Israel Defense Forces have claimed Hamas hoards fuel stores for its own use rather than making it available for civilian use.Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director for charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said some of the premature babies had been born amid the latest round of fighting.""On that ward there is a 32-week-old baby who doctors managed to save after its mother was killed in an air strike,"" she told the BBC. ""The mother and whole family died but the baby was saved.""She says death is certain for the child, and others on the same ward, if the generators stop running.The fuel to keep them switched on is in short supply.© 2023 BBC.

BBC,1 day ago,"As the ripple effects from the war between Israel and Hamas are felt around the world, Palestinian and Jewish Americans describe a growing sense of fear due to a rise in threats and harassment.As hundreds of people gathered for a peaceful rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on 13 October, a man wielding a gun started yelling racial slurs.People scattered, running for their lives, said Omar Mussa, who had helped organise the pro-Palestinian event on the steps of the state Capitol.""He came to this rally to inflict fear and terror onto us,"" the 30-year-old Palestinian American told the BBC. ""The last thing that you want is to be fearful to gather with your people and to speak about your truth and to speak about what you believe.""The man who allegedly pointed the firearm at the crowd while spewing Islamaphobic rhetoric has been charged with crimes including ethnic intimidation and making terroristic threats.The Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee said it has received hundreds of reports of hate incidents against Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Americans. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League said there has been a steep increase in antisemitic incidents - 107 - reported since the latest conflict began on 7 October.The incidents have drawn condemnation from President Joe Biden, who warned during an Oval Office address on Thursday that Americans could ""not stand by and stand silent"" in the face of such hate.But both experts and Jewish and Palestinian-American leaders worry the trend will persist as the war in the Middle East continues.""We're girding for a rough ride - not only because of the intensity of the conflict but the duration,"" said Brian Levin, the founding director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.Several high-profile incidents have already drawn national concern.Last week, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death and his mother seriously injured in Plainfield, Illinois. Their landlord allegedly targeted the pair because of their religion and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel.Just 30 miles (48 kilometres) away in Lombard, Illinois, hate crime charges were brought last week against a man who reportedly threatened to shoot two Muslim men.In New York City, police say a man punched a woman in the face in the subway because she was Jewish. In Utah, several Jewish congregations have reported receiving threats.Sam Spector, a rabbi in Salt Lake City, was an hour into leading a service on 8 October when he was forced to stop because of a bomb threat.Mr Spector described the shocking content of the message: ""We put bombs in every Jewish centre in Utah. They will go off in a few hours - you all deserve to die,"" it said.Dozens of congregants, including 20 children in a room nearby, had to evacuate the building.It was not the first bomb threat the congregation has experienced during Mr Spector's time working there. But since the war broke out this month, he said he has received more hateful antisemitic messages than ever before.""People take their strong opinions out and blame both local Jewish and local Muslim communities who are just folks here in America trying to live their lives,"" he said.Concerns about safety are forcing some Americans to restrict their daily activities.Mohammad Abd-Elsalam received a death threat last week from a man in Texas who told him all Palestinians ""deserve to be killed"".The national president for the Palestinian American Organizations Network, Mr Abd-Elsalam said he had begun avoiding public spaces and had told his family to do the same.""It's overwhelming,"" said Mr Abd-Elsalam. ""You don't know how to deal with [the war in Gaza], and at the same time you have to be concerned about your safety here and the safety of our community in the states.""Rabbi Spector said he has boosted security measures at his synagogue in recent weeks - there are also plans to spend close to $500,000 (£411,000) to enhance temple safety over the next few years.Still, Jewish people across the country are asking whether it's safe to attend religious services, said Niv Elis of the Jewish Federations of North America.""Our advice right now is live your Jewish life fully and be careful,"" he told the BBC.Mr Mussa said heightened tensions in the Middle East have led to threats not only against Palestinians, but several Muslim groups, as some incorrectly view the broader Muslim community as a ""monolith"".He said those who wear religious coverings such as a hijab were often the most vulnerable.""Individuals who look somewhat like a minority or look like they're an immigrant are targeted,"" he said. ""People are more scared now to walk the streets.""As minority groups, both Muslim and Jewish communities in the US have long histories of dealing with discrimination and threats. But experts said that hate crimes tended to rise during times of tensions in the Middle East.Jessica Winegar, a professor of anthropology and Middle East studies at Northwestern University, said that the current war in Gaza was especially fraught.""We have never seen this level of killing in this short amount of time,"" she said. ""It really is a much more heightened moment in this conflict.""The polarised nature of American politics only added fuel to the fire, experts explained.The intense debate over the complex, long-running conflict in the Middle East is now another point of contention between the left and right in the US - and those on the extremes may be more likely to lash out at someone they erroneously blame.Ms Winegar said government officials and local community leaders had a critical role to play in denouncing acts of hate and expressing sympathy for innocent civilians on both sides of the conflict.Mr Mussa, the Palestinian-American from the rally at Pennsylvania's state Capitol, said he did exactly that at his protest, while also criticising Israel's policies. But he believes the suffering of Palestinian civilians is ignored by much of the political establishment, and that has consequences in the US too.""This is emboldening individuals in this country to treat us like animals, to not see us as equals, to not see us as Americans,"" Mr Mussa told the BBC.While President Biden promised ironclad support for Israel in the aftermath of the Hamas attack - and has also requested Congress provide an extra $14bn (£11.5bn) in aid to the country - he expressed condolences for Palestinians killed in Gaza in his address to the nation.""We mourn every innocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity,"" he said.And he too made the connection with how the rage in Israel and Gaza can turn into hate crimes in the US, impacting Jews and Muslims alike.""And to all you hurting...I want you to know I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You're all America.""This video can not be playedBiden: Abandoning Israel and Ukraine 'not worth it'© 2023 BBC.

BBC,1 day ago,"Thousands of people have taken part in a pro-Palestinian protest in London for the second consecutive weekend.The Met Police estimated up to 100,000 people had joined the march, which ended in a rally near Downing Street.More than 1,000 officers were involved in policing the demonstration, and 10 people were arrested.Smaller demonstrations also took place on Saturday in Birmingham, Belfast, Cardiff and Salford.After Saturday's march in London, the Metropolitan Police said arrests were linked to possession of fireworks, public order and assaulting an emergency service worker.The Met said on Sunday it was taking no further action after footage appeared online of a man at a smaller rally close to the main march chanting ""jihad, jihad"". A statement from the force said it ""had not identified any offences arising from the specific clip"".It also said no further action would be taken after it reviewed photographs of protesters holding banners referring to ""Muslim armies"".The government intends to hold talks with the Met over the decisions after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said ""a lot of people"" would find the Met's analysis ""surprising"".""That's something that we intend to raise with them and to discuss this incident with them,"" he said.Protesters on the London march were heard chanting a slogan that some use to call for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel.Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said the slogan ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" calls for the destruction of Israel.She has previously urged police chief constables to ""consider... whether its use in certain contexts may amount to a racially aggravated"" offence, although the Met has said the chant alone does not constitute a criminal act.In Belfast, protesters held a demonstration outside BBC Northern Ireland headquarters.People Before Profit assembly member Gerry Carroll said they aimed to ""challenge"" how the BBC had covered the conflict in the Middle East.A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had provided audiences around the world with coverage and first-hand testimony ""of the atrocities committed by Hamas, and the suffering in Gaza"".""We have made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Israel and Gaza, and the unprecedented nature of what has happened,"" the spokesperson added.The demonstration in Salford was held outside the Media City complex, where the BBC has its offices - with protesters there also criticising the corporation for its reporting of the conflict.In Cardiff, around 1,000 protesters waving Palestinian flags and supportive placards took part in a march towards the Welsh Parliament.The demonstration was organised by several groups who are calling on the British and Welsh governments to insist on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and for ""full humanitarian aid"" to be sent in.Maggie Morgan, from the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign Cardiff, said: ""We are taking to the streets as a show of solidarity to the people of Gaza, to show our support for them, but also to make the government listen, and say 'not in our name, we're not having this.'""All crossings between Israel and Gaza have been closed since the Hamas attack on Israel. The Rafah crossing, which is controlled by Egypt, has also been largely closed, but an aid convoy was permitted to enter on Saturday.Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, US and European Union - launched a deadly attack against Israeli civilians on 7 October.More than 1,400 people were killed when gunmen breached security at the Gaza barrier and raided communities in southern Israel, with survivors reporting widespread atrocities including torture and bodies being burnt. More than 200 people were taken to Gaza as hostages.Officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 4,600 people have been killed over the last two weeks after Israel began retaliatory air strikes.On Saturday, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said it would ""deepen"" and ""increase"" the strikes, in order to allow Israel to ""minimise the risks to our forces in the next stages of the war"".The UN says strikes on Gaza, a densely-populated enclave bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt, have displaced around 1.4 million people, with more than half a million staying in shelters.About 200,000 Israelis have been displaced, according to the Israeli government.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said there should be increased humanitarian access to Gaza.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Sunak - who this week visited Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt - said the UK supported Israel's right to defend itself against a ""murderous enemy"" but the area faced an ""acute humanitarian crisis"".He said people in Gaza were suffering and he wanted to see a ""stream of trucks"" passing through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, and the restoration of water supplies to Gaza ""where physically possible"".Earlier on Saturday, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly warned the conflict is threatening to engulf the Middle East.Mr Cleverly has visited Israel, Turkey and Qatar as part of diplomatic efforts around the worsening crisis in Israel and the Occupied Territories.Speaking at the Cairo Peace Summit, he said: ""This has been an issue which has long stimulated passions and we are now all seeing on social media and in our communities how divisive and polarising the current situation has become.""So we have a duty to work together to prevent instability from engulfing the region and claiming yet more lives.""© 2023 BBC.

It released images of what it said were entrances to the compound, alongside images of weapons, computers and security measures pictured at the site.The IDF did not confirm whether a plane, helicopter or drone had been used in the Jenin strike on Sunday, but Israeli media reported that it was a fighter jet.The reports said that, if confirmed, it would be only the second time in about two decades that a fighter jet had hit a target in the West Bank.The Palestinian Authority's health ministry says two other Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank overnight. It brings the total number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since 7 October to 89.The PA governs parts of the West Bank that are not under full Israeli control.

Banners from People Before Profit, the Socialist Party and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation were on display as protesters gathered at City Hall.There was a significant PSNI presence, with roads closed to facilitate the demonstration.A BBC spokesperson said the corporation had provided audiences around the world with coverage and first-hand testimony ""of the atrocities committed by Hamas, and the suffering in Gaza"".""We have made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Israel and Gaza, and the unprecedented nature of what has happened,"" the spokesperson added.""We have reported on the atrocities committed by Hamas in their assault on Israel and have heard many accounts from survivors of these attacks and family members of the victims, reflecting the trauma they are suffering.""Careful consideration has been given to all aspects of our coverage to ensure that we report on developments accurately and with due impartiality in line with the BBC Editorial Guidelines, which are publicly available.""Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill attended a rally in Dungannon, County Tyrone, to express ""solidarity with the Palestinian people"".She called on the Israeli government to stop its bombing and blockade of Gaza, ""the occupation, illegal settlements and apartheid"".""The international community must step up and call for a full, immediate ceasefire,"" she said in a tweet.""This is not self-defence.

BBC,3 days ago,"Abed Wadi was getting dressed for the funeral when the message arrived.It was an image, forwarded to him by a friend, of a group of masked men posing with axes, a petrol canister, and a chainsaw, with text printed on the image in Hebrew and Arabic.""To all the rats in the sewers of Qusra village, we are waiting for you and we will not mourn you,"" the text said.""The day of revenge is coming.""Qusra was Wadi's village, in the northern part of the West Bank near Nablus. The funeral that day was for four Palestinians from the village. Three had been killed the previous day - Wednesday 11 October - after Israeli settlers entered Qusra and attacked a Palestinian family home.The fourth was shot dead in clashes with Israeli soldiers that followed.The following day, the Qusra villagers were preparing to set out for a hospital half an hour away and return with the bodies of the dead. To do so, they would need to travel across land that is dotted with Israeli settlements, where the risk of violence, high even in ordinary times, has risen dramatically in the two weeks since the Hamas attack that launched a war with Israel.Wadi put his phone down and continued getting dressed. There were four men in refrigerators in the hospital who needed to be brought home. He was not going to be deterred by a threat, he said. He had heard too many.There was no way for Wadi to know that, in a few hours' time, hardline Israeli settlers would confront the funeral procession and his own brother and young nephew would be shot dead.""If we had delayed one or even two days, what good would it have done?"" Wadi said, sitting in the shaded courtyard of his family home in Qusra.""Do you think that the settlers would have left this place on the second day?""According to the UN's humanitarian office, the week that followed Hamas's murderous attack was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since it began reporting fatalities in 2005, with at least 75 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military or settlers, and incidents of settler violence up from an average of three a day to eight.In one raid on a Palestinian refugee camp, and a rare air strike in the region, on Thursday 12th, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Palestinian officials said, and Israeli police said one officer was killed.There was ""a real risk"" of the occupied territory ""spiralling out of control"", the UN said this week.Palestinian residents of the West Bank say that while the world's attention is drawn to the unfolding disaster in Gaza, Israeli settlers are taking advantage by entering villages and expelling, and even killing, Palestinian civilians.In at least three cases, according to video footage or eyewitness testimony from villagers, the settlers have been wearing military uniforms or accompanied by the Israeli military in their attacks.The first three men who died in Qusra had gone to defend a family in a house on the outskirts of the village, after settlers approached the house and began throwing rocks at it, several residents told the BBC.They say the settlers then opened fire at the Palestinian neighbours who came to assist, killing two teenagers and a young man - Hasan Abu Sorour, 16, Obayda Abu Sorour, 17, and Musab Abu Reda, 25 - and gravely wounding several others. Moath Odeh, aged 21, was killed later in clashes with soldiers.Among the wounded were a father and his six-year-old daughter, who lived at the house, who were shot in the face and in the abdomen respectively, according to two people who received the dead and wounded at a nearby medical clinic.One of those assisting at the clinic was Amer Odeh, a cousin of two of the victims. It fell to Amer to call Said Odeh, the father of 17-year-old Obayda.""I told him, your son is lightly injured,"" Amer said, in an interview alongside Said in Qusra on Tuesday. ""I could not give him this shock over the phone.""Said rushed to the medical centre. ""They told me that my son was injured but there was no way for me to see him at that moment,"" he recalled, his eyes shiny with tears.""I told them I wanted to see my son now, and I entered that room and I saw that by the grace of God he had been martyred.""The following day was set to be the funeral for the four victims. Abed Wadi put the image of the masked men with axes and chainsaws out of his mind and joined the funeral convoy bringing the bodies back from the hospital to Qusra.As the cars and ambulances made their way along the Nablus-Ramallah road, the convoy was ambushed by hardline Israeli settlers. In the clash that followed, according to video footage and eyewitness testimony, settlers pelted the convoy with stones, some members of the funeral convoy threw stones back, and the Israeli settlers and soldiers responded with live fire.In the ""chaos and heavy, random gunfire,"" Abed Wadi lost track of his brother, Ibrahim, a 63-year-old local politician with the Fatah Movement, and Ibrahim's son Ahmed, a 24-year-old law student. Video footage of part of the confrontation appears to show Ahmed and others running away from the gunfire, before Ahmed is cut down by bullets on the road.""They told me my nephew was shot twice in his stomach and once in his neck, and my brother was shot in his waist, towards his heart,"" Wadi said.""There were no weapons in our funeral convoy,"" he said. ""Usually we would fly the Palestinian flag from the cars but we did not even fly our flag, because of the fear.""Residents in Qusra told the BBC this week that fear had permeated the village. Last weekend was the beginning of olive season in the area, but residents who depend on the harvest for their income said they would not go to the groves on the outskirts of the village for fear of settlers shooting.There had already been a significant increase in violence by Israeli settlers this year, even before the Hamas attack, according to UN data, with more than 100 incidents reported each month and about 400 people driven from their land between January and August.Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem told the BBC that since the attack, it had documented ""a concerted and organised effort by settlers to use the fact that the entire international and local attention is focused on Gaza and the north of Israel to try to seize land in the West Bank"".Partial data compiled by B'Tselem, covering the first six days after the Hamas attack, recorded at least 46 separate incidents in which it said settlers threatened, physically attacked or damaged the property of Palestinians in the West Bank.""A lot of shepherding families and communities have fled because they were threatened in the past week by settlers,"" said Roy Yellin, a spokesman for B'Tselem. ""Settlers have been giving residents a deadline to leave and telling them if they don't they will be harmed. And some villages have been totally emptied out.""One of those villages was Wadi al-Siq, near Ramallah, previously home to a Palestinian Bedouin community of about 200. ""For months we have been facing harassment and attacks from settlers day and night, but since the start of the war the attacks increased,"" said Abdul Rahman Kaabna, 48, a farmer from Wadi al-Siq.On 9 October, a group of approximately 60 settlers, many dressed in military uniforms, attacked the community, according to three now-exiled residents. ""They attacked us with weapons and terrified everyone,"" Kaabna said. ""Then they gave us one hour to go out with our sheep and threatened us to death if we didn't leave.""The residents walked more than 10km (6.2 miles) to escape, said another resident, Ali Arara, 35. ""The settlers stole everything from our homes,"" he said. ""My daughter was terrified. They beat us and left us with nothing.""According to B'Tselem and Yesh Din, another Israeli human rights group which monitors West Bank violence, the intimidation and forced displacement reported in Wadi al-Siq has been repeated in communities across the territory since 7 October.In one of the most shocking incidents caught on film in the past week, an Israeli settler entered a Palestinian village called Al-Tuwani near Hebron and shot an unarmed Palestinian resident in the stomach at point blank range, while an Israeli soldier appeared to look on.The incident began when two armed settlers, accompanied by a soldier, attacked a home on the outskirts of the village, according to three residents including the homeowner.""Three Israelis came to my house, they were armed, and one was wearing the uniform of the army,"" said Musab Rabai, 36.""One of the settlers came into the house, pushed me and beat me on the head with the gun and told me he was going to shoot me.""Neighbours responded to Rabai's shouts for help, he said. Among them was Zakriha Adra, a father of four. Video footage filmed by Adra's cousin, Basel, shows the settler who allegedly beat Rabai and the Israeli soldier standing a short distance away from the group of Palestinian neighbours. The armed settler then suddenly approaches Adra, strikes him with his rifle and shoots him in the stomach from just a few feet away.Throughout the encounter, Adra appears to be holding his arms by his sides in a non-threatening manner.This video can not be playedZakriha Adra was wounded by a shot to his stomach at close range. Video courtesy of B'TselemAccording to the family, Adra is now in hospital in critical condition. ""He survived but the bullet has done a lot of damage inside his stomach,"" said Basel, his cousin.Musab Rabai, whose house was attacked, said the shooting had been a culmination of days of threatening behaviour and property destruction by the settlers.""Since Saturday they have been standing around the village armed with guns and using a bulldozer to destroy trees,"" he said. ""The men here in the village have been sleeping in shifts, only a few hours each, so there is always someone awake in case the settlers attack.""The BBC asked the Yesha Council, the umbrella organisation for the settlers in the West Bank and elsewhere, to comment for this story but they declined. Moti Yogev, the acting head of the Binyamin Council, which also represents settlers in the region, said that violent settlers ""belonged to the fringes"" of the settler community. ""If they do exist, they should be dealt with like any other criminal,"" he said.The Israeli military and Israeli police force did not respond to multiple requests for comment.""The most tragic thing is that the violence by these extreme settlers does not produce any response from the Israeli military,"" said Dov Khenin, a former Israeli politician turned peace activist. ""And the violence has its own purpose, to get rid of these small Palestinian communities, to eject them from their homes.""The fear for many Palestinians now is that the situation in the West Bank will only get worse. Israel's National Security Minister, Itar Ben Gvir, announced last week that the government would purchase 10,000 rifles to arm Israeli civilians, including those in West Bank settlements - a move that threatens to further blur the lines between armed settlers and members of the military in the occupied territory.In Qusra, Abed Wadi said he had heard the news about the 10,000 rifles. He shook his head. ""It won't change anything for the people of Qusra,"" he said.Wadi was sitting in his courtyard, surrounded by posters bearing the image of his brother, his nephew, and the four other men from the village who were killed last week.""We have always seen the rifle in the hands of the settlers, they have been shooting at us for a long time,"" he said.But something had changed, he said. It seemed as though the settlers had become more aggressive, more radical. ""Farm houses are being burned, olive trees cut down, cars broken into, land is being stolen,"" Wadi said.""And this is just our village. If you were to look to the next village and the next village, you would find anger and pain in every one,"" he said. ""And you would see no end to it.""Alla Badarna contributed to this report.

BBC,4 days ago,"This video can not be playedBiden: Abandoning Israel and Ukraine 'not worth it'US President Joe Biden has said world history is at ""an inflection point"" as he made the case for billions of dollars in wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel.In a speech at the White House, he said Hamas and Russia both wanted to ""annihilate a neighbouring democracy"".Mr Biden said he would send an urgent funding request - expected to be $105bn (£87bn) - to Congress on Friday.But the House of Representatives has no leader and can't approve any spending.Mr Biden's rare primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office on Thursday evening was just the second of his presidency.It came a day after his whirlwind trip to Israel following the attacks by Hamas on 7 October.Mr Biden said the emergency aid request would ""pay dividends for American security for generations"".In his 15-minute address, he also condemned any acts of hatred against Jews or Muslims in the US, and condemned the fatal stabbing of six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea al-Fayoume in Chicago this week.""We must without equivocation denounce anti-Semitism,"" he said. ""We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia.""The White House has not yet officially released details about the expected aid package.But a source familiar with the request told the BBC's US partner CBS News it would include:Mr Biden also took great care to stress his sympathy for the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as talking about meeting the families of Israeli and US victims of the Hamas attacks.Democrats hope that by tying the different aid packages together they can win support for the Ukraine funding, which some Republicans oppose.But the request will arrive at an effectively frozen Congress, as House Republicans have been unable to elect a Speaker after Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a right-wing revolt more than two weeks ago.Mr Biden, who is a Democrat, did not explicitly address the political dysfunction, though he acknowledged ""divisions at home"".""We have to get past them,"" he said. ""We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibility as a great nation.""We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.""But it is unclear if the spending package would pass Congress, even with a House Speaker.The Republican leader of the Senate has indicated willingness to take up the measure, but there is opposition within the party.Eight Republicans, led by Kansas Senator Roger Marshall, wrote in a letter: ""These are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in an attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line.""Ohio Republican Senator JD Vance called Mr Biden's linking of the two conflicts ""disgusting"".""He's using dead children in Israel to sell his disastrous Ukraine policy,"" he posted on X, formerly Twitter, after the speech.There was even a sign of dissent within the Biden administration on Thursday as a state department official resigned in protest at the US decision to keep sending weapons to Israel as it lays siege to Gaza.Josh Paul, who headed the bureau that oversees arms transfers, told the BBC after quitting that he believed Israel's actions violated US legal provisions meant to restrict weapons sales to human rights abusers.""I think our mechanisms for determining violations are broken,"" he said.This video can not be playedWatch: US official quits over Israel aid: 'I had to resign'Additional reporting by Phil McCausland and Max Matza© 2023 BBC.

BBC,5 days ago,"Even before the deadly blast at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, Joe Biden's full-throated support for Israel had convinced Palestinians and millions of other Arabs that the United States was more than simply Israel's most important supporter. They believed the Americans were also complicit in everything Israel was doing in Gaza, including killing children.The bitter dispute over who was responsible for the attack will not change many minds. Twelve days of war have ramped up hatred and division.Israel produced a detailed rebuttal of accusations that it had attacked Al-Ahli. It displayed evidence that it said proved a missile fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had malfunctioned and dropped well short of its target in Israel.For Palestinians - not just supporters of Hamas - the piles of bloodstained body bags were all the proof they needed. For them, the difference at Al-Ahli was not of principle but of degree. Israel has been killing scores of Palestinians every day since it responded to the Hamas surprise attack, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reminded Mr Biden had killed at least 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Al-Ahli was, for Palestinians, more proof of Israel's disregard for their lives.The first reports of the destruction of the hospital emerged as the engines of Air Force One were warming up to bring Joe Biden to the Middle East. Before it could take off his schedule was in tatters.President Biden has a deep commitment to Israel. It must have seemed natural to him to fly into Tel Aviv to show his support and offer a public embrace to Mr Netanyahu.Mr Biden had been hoping somehow to balance that out at a hastily-arranged summit in Amman, the Jordanian capital, where he planned to meet the king of Jordan, the president of Egypt and the Palestinian president.But Jordan cancelled because of Al-Ahli. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, hurried back to his HQ in Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Jordan itself released statements condemning Israel.The trip became much harder for President Biden. Heads of state usually only travel on diplomatic missions once the hard work of negotiation has been done and a deal is ready to be signed.Coming to Tel Aviv was a gamble for President Biden. He wanted to ease Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, while supporting Israel's war effort - perhaps an impossible circle to square with Mr Netanyahu.But a deal emerged from their meeting. Israel was promised more military aid. In return it agreed to let convoys carrying food, water and medicine enter southern Gaza from Egypt. Hospitals are desperate for fuel for their generators, but when the deal was announced it was not mentioned.Apart from supporting the Israelis and reminding them to observe the laws of war, Mr Biden also wants to reinforce the message that the war must not spread. He had already deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the eastern Mediterranean, to show Iran and its ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia and political movement, that they would have the US to reckon with if they intervened.One reason why leaders inside and outside the Middle East are struggling with the renewed war between Hamas and Israel is because they are in unknown territory. The old certainties had become comforting assumptions. But now they are mostly shattered and gone.The Middle East looked to be familiar ground before the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October. A status quo existed. No leader in the region, and among its allies, liked it much but at the very least it seemed to promise stability.Most Palestinians were as surprised as anyone else when Hamas attacked. Some had criticised Hamas for supposedly forgetting that its name is an Arabic acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement.Mr Netanyahu has been condemned by his many political enemies in Israel for being asleep on the job when Hamas invaded, and for presiding over a catastrophic military and intelligence failure. Israelis thought their government could keep them safe.Another illusion related directly to Mr Netanyahu was his assumption that the Palestinians could be managed without allowing them independence. Part of that involved making deals with Hamas over issues like the numbers of workers allowed back into Israel.At the same time, using a classic tactic of divide and rule, Mr Netanyahu worked to undermine the Palestinian Authority, the main rivals of Hamas for leadership of the Palestinians. The PA took part in years of ultimately fruitless peace talks, and recognised Israel a generation ago. But to get it talking again, Israel would have to discuss transferring land to the Palestinians for a future state with a capital in Jerusalem.That idea is out of the question for Mr Netanyahu in his current incarnation as the leader of a government sustained by extreme religious nationalists. His record suggests he has never wanted to make those concessions. It was easier for him to find a way to insist Israel had no partner for peace. Mr Netanyahu, or a successor, will have to change their thinking if they want to find a way to save the next generation from more war.For leaders of the US's Arab allies, there has also been a sharp reminder that the Palestinians cannot be ignored. Jordan and Egypt have long-established peace treaties with Israel. The UAE normalised relations in the Abraham Accords. All were hoping to benefit from Joe Biden's plan to create a new Middle East, and a foreign policy achievement to boast about, by brokering a deal in which Israel and Saudi Arabia would recognise each other in return for security guarantees from the US. Mr Biden's officials thought they were making progress. Now a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement is way off the agenda.And for Arab kings, princes and presidents, the war in Gaza and the attack on the hospital is also about the return of nightmares. At the end of 2010 a frustrated and furious market trader in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest against corrupt and bullying officials. It set off the Arab uprisings of 2011, which terrified leaders who thought they might lose everything - not just power and wealth but perhaps even their lives.If the death of an angry young man in Tunisia could be the spark for revolutions, what could be the price of a war that kills thousands of Palestinian civilians?Certainties have been shown, in less than two weeks of bloodshed, to be built on sand. The new status quo will emerge from war. Perhaps the shock it creates will force new thinking. If it simply reinforces the old ways, the outlook is grim.Correction 19th October: This article originally said that Al-Ahli hospital has been destroyed and has been amended to clarify that the building was the site of a deadly explosion.Are you in the region?
