Fox News,"  October 17, 2023 2:00am EDT","Joe Biden’s presidency is tracking Jimmy Carter’s four years in the Oval Office so faithfully it must give his campaign team hives. Recent events in Israel create even more parallels. It was a Middle East crisis that brought down Jimmy Carter’s presidency; the current conflict in the region could prove Biden’s undoing as well.In 1979, more than 50 U.S. citizens were taken hostage in Iran, and Carter failed to secure their release. Worse, a U.S. military mission sent to rescue the prisoners failed, infuriating Americans. Carter’s foreign policy blunders sank his reelection bid, but they were far from his only problem. His administration was considered weak and inept, and the events in Tehran reinforced those perceptions.Like Biden, Carter was already in trouble when the hostage crisis occurred. The Georgia peanut farmer presided over sky-high inflation: so has Biden. Carter pushed enormous and controversial increases in government spending: ditto Biden. Like Biden, Carter started with high approval numbers that went pretty much straight downhill.BIDEN ISSUES CRYPTIC WARNING TO IRAN AFTER ADMIN DENIES COUNTRY WAS INVOLVED IN HAMAS ATTACK: 'BE CAREFUL'As he approached reelection in 1980, Carter faced a primary battle from fellow Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy; nearing next year’s presidential election, another Kennedy -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – was until recently attempting to mount a primary challenge against Biden. History may not repeat but it sure does rhyme.Today, 30 Americans have been murdered by Hamas and more than a dozen are being held captive.  Voters will hold President Biden responsible for punishing the terrorists responsible for those deaths, and for bringing both American hostages and those trapped by war home safely.So far, the Biden White House has not impressed. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted eight days before Hamas’ invasion of Israel that, ""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,"" displaying either incredible ignorance or unjustifiable smugness.   https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/jake-sullivan-defends-saying-middle-east-region-was-quieter-days-hamas-rcna120490Elsewhere, it turns out that Robert Malley, Biden administration’s ""special envoy"" to Iran, who is known to have had close contacts with Hamas, was put on leave from his State Department post several months ago.  Officially, he has been accused of mishandling classified documents, but there is speculation that he has long worked on behalf not of the U.S. but of Iranian interests.Biden and his national security team have refused to accuse Iran for complicity in Hamas’ attack on Israel, claiming repeatedly there is no evidence of Tehran’s involvement. That is untrue. There is increasing proof that the planning for the attack went on for months, discussed by senior officials of both Hamas and Hezbollah meeting with leaders of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Beirut.Biden is understandably loathe to implicate Iran in Hamas’ atrocities. Confronting Tehran could escalate the hostilities in the region, and would also boost oil prices, which would inevitably hurt Biden’s approval ratings. Also, Biden’s White House, foolishly pursuing a nuclear pact, has enriched and emboldened the mullahs, in part by loosening enforcement of sanctions; voters will not look kindly on that decision.Wisconsin Representative Scott Fitzgerald wrote recently in an op-ed, ""Relaxing sanctions has allowed Iran to generate oil revenues exceeding $80 billion annually while strengthening its relationship with China. As I warned in April 2021, using China to dodge U.S. sanctions allows Iran to funnel money to its proxy forces in the Middle East, including the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hamas, which is armed, funded, and led by the Iranian regime.""At the same time, there has been a spike in the number of people on the terror watch list who have been apprehended at the uncontrolled southern border, through which millions of people have entered our country illegally since Biden took office. Fox News reports that four Iranians have been caught since October 1, heightening concerns.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONOur State Department has been slow to help evacuate Americans from Israel, even as other countries have arranged to airlift their citizens to safety. In addition, recent news reports show U.S. citizens responding to our government’s advisory and arriving at the Egyptian border, only to find it blocked and being told to go home.The Biden White House claims to be ""surging additional military assistance"" to our ally. Given that Biden goofed some months ago by admitting that the conflict in Ukraine has drained our stocks of munitions, it is not clear how much we can provide.Hamas, on the other hand, appears to be well-equipped, thanks at least in part to mountains of weapons and ammunition abandoned by U.S. forces in their hasty exit from Afghanistan, which Joe Biden and his team continue to applaud as a ""success.""Meanwhile, while the world has been transfixed by the horrors taking place in Israel and Gaza, the president has carried on with his campaigning. Biden’s support for Israel may be unwavering, but his attention span is not. As Israel declared war, Biden and his wife hosted a barbeque for White House staffers; the next day the president spoke at a Rose Garden campaign event celebrating his efforts to cut down on ""junk fees.""The very next day, Biden traveled to Philadelphia to promote his green energy agenda. An agenda, we note, that includes curbing U.S. oil production and consequently driving prices higher, helping to fund Iran-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. The president may have received word that his campaigning was not well received; he abruptly canceled a trip to Colorado on Monday to ""instead hold meetings with his national security team as Israel’s war with Hamas appears set to escalate,"" as one news outlet helpfully explained.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPJimmy Carter, faced with the hostage crisis, had the decency to suspend campaigning and focus his government on the plight of the captive Americans.

The president then said, ""Our Defense Department confirmed that a Hamas rocket hit the hospital, not Israel's."" Yet the president never mentioned radical Islam. He never uttered a single word about fanatical Muslims hell-bent on ethnic cleansing. Never touched it. Skipped right over the root causes. Also, never mentioned Iran.Biden is trying to soft-pedal Iranian involvement because his administration has been letting Iran get away with murder for years. To his credit, President Trump had demolished ISIS, assassinated Soleimani and pulled out of the nuke deal and slapped crippling sanctions on that country's energy sector. He had great relationships with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, all the major Arab players. And Israel was cutting deals with these Arabs and now the deals are on hold because of Iranian mischief.And Biden isn't going to be able to put this back together. He's just not.

However, one source noted that these circumstances can devolve quickly. It was underscored to Fox that if nothing else, the Middle East violence highlights the importance of having an operational House of Representatives and a Speaker.""The Middle East might speed up the election of a Speaker,"" said one House Republican who asked to remain nameless.

There are now rumblings that perhaps McCarthy could rise from the political ashes like a phoenix and return to the Speaker’s suite.Police officers check suspects at a check point, searching for Hamas militants from Gaza strip on October 8, 2023, in Ashdod, Israel. On Saturday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the largest surprise attack from Gaza in a generation, sending thousands of missiles and an unknown number of fighters by land, who shot and kidnapped Israelis in communities near the Gaza border. The attack prompted retaliatory strikes on Gaza and a declaration of war by the Israeli prime minister. (Amir Levy/Getty Images)""Don’t be surprised if you see calls just like that for Kevin to re-emerge,"" said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Penn.) on Fox before the Middle East crisis.After all, a supermajority of all House Republicans support McCarthy. Many think the junta of eight Republicans who voted to banish McCarthy did so with little cause and were far from justified in doing so. Thus, McCarthy might be the most-electable figure in the House considering global circumstances.But for now, the House cannot function. This would be a far worse scenario if American adversaries like Russia, China, North Korea or Iran were to do something to the U.S. now.But here’s the problem for McHenry. The House created the concept of ""Speaker Pro Tempore"" as part of ""continuity of government"" concerns following 9/11. The House did not anticipate installing a Speaker Pro Tempore over a political dispute which resulted in the removal of the sitting Speaker.DOZENS OF US LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS STRANDED IN WAR-WORN ISRAELScholars argue that McHenry cannot do anything to run the House except gavel in, gavel out and preside over the election of a new Speaker. However, there is some parliamentary evidence that the House did advance a minor resolution in 1814 after House Speaker Henry Clay briefly stepped aside.While the intelligence community may be willing to include McHenry in national security matters now, there is concern among House institutionalists about every action McHenry may take right now.The House operates off a series of precedents: Hinds’, Deschler’s and Cannon’s. These books dictate future maneuvers of the House – predicated on how the House operated in the past. Any action McHenry takes as Speaker Pro Tempore establishes a new precedent, dictating the authority of potential future Speakers Pro Tempores.As it was put to Fox, if McHenry is aggressive in wielding power, that will give the next Speaker Pro Tempore wider latitude. One source said that if McHenry goes too far, that establishes a precedent which may cause some in Congress to ask why they even bother to elect a Speaker and may just start ""appointing a Speaker Pro Tempore by 2055.""Representative Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2023. (Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images)In other words, if McHenry takes an intelligence briefing on the Middle East, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that. If he tries to advance a bill on the floor, future Speakers Pro Tempore may do that, too.""This is mission creep for a Speaker Pro Tempore,"" said one knowledgeable House parliamentary source. ""A crisis could completely change the role for the future.""But consider this. The House decision to create a ""Speaker Pro Tempore"" after 9/11 was so there was a functioning institution amid a crisis. Surely leaders thought that the Speaker Pro Tempore could take action to respond to critical events. Granted, there isn’t a vacancy in the Speakership because the Speaker was killed in a 9/11-style terrorism attack. But the imprimatur is that the House wanted the body to be functional. And right now, the body is not.So…Fox is told this is why McHenry may be reluctant to take any action on any subject until the House elects a bona fide Speaker. He is handcuffed. But each move by McHenry could widen the authority for the role. Fox is told that’s why McHenry appears to be mindful and judicious in the use of any perceived powers he may have now.""There are guardrails,"" said one source. ""But because this is unprecedented, they don’t have to be followed.""On Friday afternoon, it looked as though it may take days to elect a Speaker. But, as Harold MacMillan postulated, ""events"" sometimes alter the course of governing.House Republicans are scheduled to meet for a closed door House GOP Conference meeting late Monday.On Tuesday, House GOPers will conduct their ""candidate forum"" where those running for the Speakership make their pitches to rank-and-file Members. Then, the Republican Conference will convene again behind closed doors on Wednesday for a ""secret ballot"" to tap their nominee for Speaker. This is NOT the Speaker election. The FULL HOUSE must elect the Speaker. And the number needed to prevail on the floor is much higher than the number needed to win in the conference.On one hand, this is why it could take House Republicans a while to sort out the Speakership.

According to analysts, the conflict — triggered over the weekend after a series of unprovoked attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis — may lead to large amounts of global oil supplies being withheld.""If the conflict envelopes Iran... up to 3% of global oil supply is at risk.

The SPR currently contains 351.3 million barrels of oil, 44% lower than it was in January 2021 when Biden took office and a level last recorded in September 1983 prior to this year.Since taking office, Biden has ordered the Department of Energy to release a total of about 260 million barrels of oil stored in the SPR to combat high fuel prices that hit consumers in late 2021 and mid 2022.
